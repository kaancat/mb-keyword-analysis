# Potentialeanalyse: Aeflyt.dk

## 1. Executive Summary
**Adam & Eva Flytteservice (Aeflyt.dk)** has a strong foundation with a clear focus on "Flytning med kærlig hånd" and specialized services for both business (Erhvervsflytning) and private customers. Currently, there appears to be no active Google Ads presence, representing a significant missed opportunity to capture high-intent traffic.

Our analysis shows substantial search volume for core terms like "flyttefirma" and "erhvervsflytning", particularly in the Zealand (Sjælland) region. By implementing a structured Google Ads strategy, Aeflyt can expect to generate consistent leads with a positive ROI.
