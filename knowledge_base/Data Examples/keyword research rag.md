“keyword_research_methods”: [
“Framework 1 – Seed → Expand → Qualify → Model: Start with business-driven seeds (site IA, product catalog, CRM reasons for buying, sales call transcripts, internal search logs). Expand using Google Keyword Planner Discover new keywords and Organize keywords into ad groups together with tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Wordstream to pull related and long-tail ideas. ￼ Qualify by (a) intent (must be commercial or transactional for performance campaigns), (b) CPC/competition vs expected CPA, and (c) SERP fit (ads + commercial organic results). Model volume/cost using Keyword Planner forecasts; only promote a theme to its own ad group if it can realistically generate ≥300–500 searches/month or ≥20 clicks/day at target CPC in that geo; otherwise keep it aggregated. ￼”,
“Framework 2 – Competitor-First PPC Recon: Use Ahrefs/Semrush paid reports to pull competitors’ active paid keywords, estimated spend, and landing pages, then reverse-engineer which themes they clearly value (consistent presence, high CPC, recurring ad creatives). ￼ Rule: If 3+ direct competitors defend a keyword with high CPC and bottom-of-funnel intent, treat it as core and plan a dedicated cluster. If competitors are absent and the SERP is mostly informational/SEO content, deprioritize for pure lead/sales campaigns even if the volume looks good.”,
“Framework 3 – SERP & Intent Mining: For each candidate theme, inspect SERPs manually or via tools; identify presence of Shopping, Local Pack, Ads density, and top-ranking content type. ￼ Rule: If SERP shows 3–4 top ads with strongly commercial language and product/service pages ranking in organic, classify as Transactional/Commercial → high priority for search. If SERP has mostly how-to guides and few or no search ads, classify as Informational → send to content/upper-funnel, not core search lead-gen.”,
“Framework 4 – Query Log & N‑gram Mining: For existing accounts, mine Search Terms reports and export to run n‑gram analysis (one-, two-, three-word patterns) to identify profitable sub-phrases and systematic wasters. ￼ Rule: Promote n‑grams that appear in ≥50 clicks with CVR ≥ 1.5× ad group average into their own keywords or ad groups; block n‑grams that spend ≥2× your target CPA with zero conversions as phrase/broad negatives (e.g., “free”, “jobs”, “DIY”).”,
“Framework 5 – Zero-Volume & Long-Tail Strategy: Treat Keyword Planner volume for specific, commercial phrases as directional, not absolute; many “0–10” terms will still generate impressions and conversions. ￼ Rule: If a long-tail term has crystal-clear buying intent and syntactically mirrors how sales describe deals (“emergency 24 hour plumber ”), include it even at 0 volume, but cluster these long-tails under a broader ad group theme and avoid building SKAGs for each. Promote to their own ad group only after you see ≥30–50 clicks and 3+ conversions with distinct performance.”,
“Framework 6 – Economic Filter (Auction Viability): Use CPC benchmarks and Competitive Density/Top of page bid estimates to decide if you can afford to compete. ￼ Rule: For a given theme, estimate: Required CPC = Target CPA × Target CVR. If the market CPC is consistently ≥1.5× your Required CPC and you cannot raise AOV/LTV, deprioritize or move to remarketing/Display where CPM is cheaper instead of forcing search.”,
“Framework 7 – Master Keyword List & De-dupe Workflow: Build one master sheet that combines (a) tool keywords, (b) search term exports, (c) competitor terms, (d) product catalog terms, then de-duplicate and tag columns for intent, funnel stage, product line, geo, and brand/non-brand. ￼ Only when a term has tags for both intent and product do you place it into campaign/ad group structure. Rule: Never build structure directly inside Keyword Planner; always normalize in a master list first so later restructures are possible without re-research.”
],
“search_intent_frameworks”: [
“4-Intent Model → PPC Mapping: Classify every keyword as Informational, Navigational, Commercial, or Transactional. ￼ Rules: (1) Informational → target with cheap CPC content campaigns (DSA, Performance Max, or discovery) and remarketing; avoid as core search lead-gen unless you have lead magnets. (2) Navigational (brand/URL/brand+login) → always go into Brand campaigns with aggressive bids and impression share targets. (3) Commercial investigation (“best X software”, “X vs Y”) → mid-funnel campaigns with comparison-focused landing pages, not generic homepages. (4) Transactional (“buy”, “near me”, “price”, “quote”) → highest bids, strict conversion optimization, and strongest offers.”,
“SERP Signal Matrix: Use a simple decision table: If SERP shows Local Pack + map + local ads → intent = Local Transactional; send to location-constrained campaigns with tight radius. If SERP = shopping carousel + price-rich ads → intent = Product Transactional; prioritize Shopping/PMax plus high-intent search. If SERP = FAQs, featured snippet, People Also Ask, and few/no ads → intent = Informational; move to content/SEO or cheap discovery campaigns. ￼”,
“Funnel Mapping Rules: Map keyword intent to funnel stage and KPI. Top-of-funnel (Informational) → CPM/CTR, email/remarketing list growth. Mid-funnel (Commercial) → micro-conversions (demo views, calculators, downloads). Bottom-of-funnel (Transactional/Navigational) → hard conversions (leads, sales). Rule: Never judge TOFU keywords on last-click ROAS; require view-through and assisted metrics; never judge BOFU keywords on cheap CPC alone—optimize by CPA/ROAS.”,
“Query → Asset Alignment: For each intent class, define default asset rules. Informational queries → RSAs referencing guides/checklists, land on content hub or explainer with light CTAs. Commercial queries → RSAs highlighting differentiators, social proof, detailed feature pages. Transactional queries → RSAs with prices, urgency, strong CTA, shortest path to conversion page (quote form, product page, booking widget). Quality Score improves when landing page content clearly matches query intent. ￼”,
“Intent Conflict Rule: If a query pattern mixes intents (e.g., “CRM free trial vs alternatives”), isolate such queries into their own ad groups once they produce ≥30–50 clicks or ≥5 conversions so you can test intent-specific messaging, instead of letting them dilute more focused ad groups.”
],
“match_type_rules”: [
“Role Definitions (2025 reality): Broad match finds new queries with same meaning and relies heavily on Smart Bidding signals (user behavior, location, device, etc.). Phrase match covers queries with the same meaning where order is preserved, but allows additional words before/after. Exact match covers searches that have the same meaning or intent as the keyword, including close variants. ￼ Negative match types (broad/phrase/exact) restrict traffic and are often more powerful than positive match types in controlling intent. ￼”,
“Broad Match Usage Rules: Use broad match primarily when (a) you have robust, accurate conversion tracking including value-based bidding, and (b) you can run at least ~30 conversions per campaign per month to train Smart Bidding. Below that, broad tends to explore too aggressively and can burn budget. Keep broad within tightly themed ad groups and pair with strong negative keyword lists. Avoid broad-only strategies in ultra-niche B2B with very low search volume and high CPC; in those cases, start with phrase/exact and add broad only when you’ve built a good negative base.”,
“Phrase Match Usage Rules: Default match for new performance campaigns with moderate budgets. Use phrase when you want to capture variant queries that keep the core phrase and meaning intact but avoid some of the broader lateral expansion of broad match. Phrase is best when you have clearly defined head terms (“emergency plumber”, “B2B SaaS billing software”) and need scale beyond exact while still controlling wild intents. If phrase keywords continuously receive a high proportion (>40%) of irrelevant search terms even with negatives, either tighten negatives or consider switching those ad groups to exact-only.”,
“Exact Match Usage Rules: Use exact for (a) highest-value queries where you can justify aggressive bidding, (b) terms with proven performance (≥50–100 clicks and ≥5–10 conversions historically), and (c) brand and competitor names where message must be extremely precise. Rule-of-thumb: For each major theme, maintain a core set of 5–20 exact keywords representing the top revenue-driving queries; bid them ~10–30% higher than equivalent phrase keywords when using manual/portfolio CPC, because they typically convert better and can justify higher CPCs. ￼”,
“Hybrid Match Strategy: For most accounts, build each high-value theme with a trio: 1–3 broad match anchors, 3–10 phrase keywords, and 5–20 exacts. Let Smart Bidding optimize bids while you actively sculpt queries through negatives. If search term mining shows >70% of conversions coming from phrase/exact and broad is contributing mostly low-quality traffic, either tighten negatives or pause broad for that theme.”,
“Threshold-Based Match Type Simplification: If a campaign has <€/$50 per day per market or yields <15 conversions/month, avoid heavy use of broad match; run mostly phrase and exact to protect budget. For higher budgets (≥€/$200 per day and ≥30–50 conversions/month), favor consolidated broad+phrase structures with aggressive negative sculpting to fully leverage Google’s AI. ￼”
],
“ad_group_structuring_rules”: [
“Theme Tightness Rule: An ad group should represent one tight commercial theme that a single RSA (plus potentially a DSA or second RSA) can speak to without awkward wording. Google explicitly recommends narrow themes per ad group and grouping similar keywords together to show more relevant ads. ￼ Practical rule: Keep 5–20 active keywords per ad group, all sharing the same root concept and landing page. If more than ~20–30 unique search terms regularly generate conversions with clearly different language, split themes.”,
“Keyword Density & Volume Rule: Maintain ad groups where at least 80% of spend is on keywords that share 1–2 core n‑grams (e.g., “emergency plumber” or “crm for agencies”). If a minority subset of queries (≥25% of clicks or spend) uses a distinct phrase that could support its own ads (≥100 clicks/month or ≥5 conversions/month), promote to its own ad group to tailor copy and negatives around that n‑gram.”,
“Quality Score & Relevance Trigger: Monitor ad group average Quality Score. If many high-volume keywords in an ad group drop below QS 6/10 with “Below average” ad relevance or landing page experience, restructure: either (a) split those keywords into a new ad group with more tailored ads/landing, or (b) move the whole theme to a more appropriate page. ￼”,
“Ad Assets Per Group Rule: Maintain at least 1 RSA with Good/Excellent Ad Strength per ad group, plus optionally a second RSA for testing a different angle (offer vs social proof vs urgency). Google and multiple PPC studies recommend at least one RSA per group, with diverse assets. ￼ When a group can’t reach Good Ad Strength even after adding 8–10 distinct headlines and 3–4 descriptions, it’s a sign the theme may be too broad or inconsistent.”,
“Search Term Coverage Rule: If an ad group’s top 20 search terms contain multiple intents (e.g., “crm software for lawyers”, “crm for agencies”, “crm tools for freelancers”) and you can’t write a single ad that is highly relevant to at least 70% of them, create separate ad groups by vertical or use DSA/catch-all campaigns for the wider set while keeping “hero” verticals in their own groups.”,
“SKAG vs STAG vs Consolidated: Single-Keyword Ad Groups (SKAGs) are rarely recommended in modern Google Ads because Google’s close variants and AI-based matching prefer consolidated, themed groups. ￼ Use STAGs (Single Theme Ad Groups): 5–20 tightly-related keywords around one concept and one landing page, with consolidation at campaign level for budget/bid strategy efficiency.”
],
“campaign_structures”: [
“Goal-First Campaign Layering: Every campaign exists to achieve one primary business objective: brand defense, non-brand acquisition, competitor conquesting, remarketing/re-engagement, or product-specific revenue. Wordstream and other guides emphasize structuring campaigns around goals and themes, not arbitrary grouping. ￼ Rule: Do not mix fundamentally different goals (brand defense + generic acquisition, or international + domestic) in one campaign because budgets/bidding will be misaligned.”,
“Network & Type Separation: Keep Search, Performance Max, and Display/Video in separate campaigns; they behave differently and require different creatives and bidding strategies. Use Search for intent capture, PMax for multi-network reach and Shopping/Local, Display/Video for awareness and remarketing. ￼”,
“Theme & Geo Structure: At campaign level, fix variables that must have separate budgets and bid strategies: location, language, bid strategy, daily budget, and often funnel stage. Typical architecture per market: (1) Brand Search campaign, (2) Non-Brand Core Search by product category, (3) Competitor Search campaign, (4) DSA catch-all or Broad discovery, (5) Remarketing/Local/PMax campaigns. ￼”,
“Bid Strategy Alignment: Keep campaigns using the same bid strategy and optimization goal grouped; do not mix Target CPA, Maximize Clicks, and Target ROAS in the same campaign. Move from Maximize Conversions → Target CPA or from Maximize Conversion Value → Target ROAS once you reach ~30–50 conversions per month in that campaign.”,
“Simplicity vs Control Principle: Google’s current best-practice guidance emphasizes simplified, consolidated account structures for better AI performance and easier management; too many small campaigns and ad groups fragment performance data, slowing Smart Bidding learning. ￼ Rule: Start simple and only add campaigns when you need different budgets, goals, or significantly different audiences/geos.”
],
“splitting_vs_consolidation_logic”: [
“Data Density Rule: Consolidate until each optimization unit (campaign/ad group) can accumulate at least 30–50 conversions per 30 days for stable Smart Bidding. ￼ If a campaign/ad group is below 15 conversions/month and you have many similarly themed siblings, consolidate them under fewer, broader units to give the algorithm more data.”,
“Query Diversity Rule: Split when the top 10–20 search terms within an ad group reflect clearly different intents or user segments AND each subset can sustain scale. Practical thresholds: If a subset of queries accounts for ≥25% of ad group spend and can independently deliver ≥100 clicks/month or ≥5–10 conversions/month, consider splitting that subset into its own ad group or campaign with tailored creatives and landing pages.”,
“Performance Divergence Rule: When subsets of keywords show materially different economics, splitting increases control. Example criteria: Subset CVR differs by ≥30% from rest of group over ≥100 clicks, or subset CPC is ≥40% higher but maintains acceptable CPA. In that case, move those keywords into a separate ad group/campaign so you can set bid adjustments or different Target CPA/ROAS without harming the rest.”,
“Budget & Pacing Rule: Split campaigns when you need budget guardrails. If one theme consistently consumes ≥60–70% of campaign daily budget but is less profitable than other themes inside the same campaign, move it to its own campaign with its own budget cap. Conversely, if multiple campaigns are frequently Limited by budget with low conversions each, consolidate them by theme or funnel stage until you remove budget fragmentation.”,
“Geo & Language Splitting: Always split campaigns when you need distinct (a) budgets by country/region, (b) currencies, or (c) languages. For multi-language within one country, best practice is separate campaigns per language so you can have language-specific keywords and ads and avoid cross-language matching. ￼”,
“Brand vs Non-Brand Separation: Keep brand and non-brand in separate campaigns by default because they have completely different CVR, CPC, and intent. ￼ This allows you to (a) protect impression share on brand at very low CPA and (b) avoid brand traffic inflating non-brand reported performance.”
],
“budget_based_decisions”: [
“Budget Tiering: Define budget tiers per market: (a) Micro: <€/$30/day, (b) Lean: €/$30–200/day, (c) Scale: €/$200–1,000/day, (d) Enterprise: >€/$1,000/day. For Micro budgets, focus only on 1–2 highest-intent themes (brand + one core non-brand), mostly phrase/exact, minimal campaign splitting. For Lean budgets, you can introduce separate brand, non-brand core, and remarketing/PMax campaigns. For Scale and Enterprise, support full funnel (brand, non-brand by product line, competitor, remarketing, PMax, DSA).”,
“Budget-Driven Match Type Rules: At Micro budgets, avoid broad match except on brand because exploration can consume too much budget; rely on phrase/exact with robust negatives. At Lean and Scale budgets, introduce broad in tightly structured themes to discover new queries, but only when conversion tracking is reliable and you can afford 20–30% of spend going to exploration. At Enterprise levels, broad-first with strong negatives and value-based bidding can be primary for non-brand.”,
“Budget Guardrail Rule: For any given theme, aim for a daily budget that can purchase at least 20–30 clicks at your expected CPC; below that, learning will be slow and performance volatile. If a theme cannot justify that budget, it belongs as part of a broader campaign, not its own. Use Keyword Planner forecasts to validate if daily budget × expected CPC yields enough clicks for your optimization goals. ￼”,
“Impression Share Thresholds: If Search Lost IS (budget) regularly exceeds ~20–30% on profitable campaigns (CPA/ROAS at or better than goal), consider increasing budget or splitting out the highest ROI themes into their own campaigns with higher budgets. Conversely, if Lost IS (rank) is high but budget is not constrained, adjust bids/Target CPA/ROAS before increasing budget.”
],
“naming_conventions”: [
“Account-Level Conventions: Standardize names across all accounts so reporting and scripts work consistently. Common campaign pattern: CC-Lang-Network-Goal-BrandStatus-Product/Theme-Geo-BidStrategy, e.g., “US-EN-Search-Lead-Brand-CRM-Core-National-tCPA” or “DE-DE-Search-Acq-NonBrand-Accounting-Software-DE-tROAS”. Include only fields that truly differ at campaign level (geo, language, objective, brand/non-brand, bid strategy).”,
“Ad Group Naming: Use Theme + Intent + MatchType hints, e.g., “Emergency-Plumber-Exact-BOFU”, “CRM-For-Lawyers-Phrase-MOFU”, “Brand-Core-Broad”. This allows you to quickly see if an ad group is bottom-of-funnel or mid-funnel, and to filter for match types in reporting. Avoid cryptic IDs; names should be understandable by any strategist in 6 months.”,
“Keyword Labels vs Names: Keywords themselves don’t have a “name”, but maintain labels for lifecycle and role: “Core”, “Exploratory”, “Competitor”, “Brand”, “Negative-Seed”, “Paused-Waster”. Rule: Use labels instead of overloading naming conventions with performance data; labels make it easy to filter for optimization routines in bulk.”,
“RSA Naming: Name ads by angle rather than by number: “Offer-Strong-Discount”, “SocialProof-G2-Reviews”, “PainPoint-Compliance-Risk”. This makes creative testing analysis easier (e.g., filter all “SocialProof” ads to compare CTR/CVR vs “Offer” variants). Tie this back into ad group structure: each ad group ideally tests 2–3 different angles, not 5 nearly identical versions.”,
“Shared Assets & Lists: Standardize negative keyword list names by scope: “Global-Generic-Negatives”, “Brand-Protection-Competitor-Negatives”, “Local-Geo-CrossTerm-Negatives”. ￼ Similarly, standardize audience list names (e.g., “All-Site-30D”, “Checkout-Abandoners-14D”, “Leads-365D”) for cross-account reuse.”
],
“negative_keyword_framework”: [
“Structural Layers: Maintain at least three layers of negative lists: (1) Global Cross-Industry Negatives (jobs, careers, free, cheap, DIY, definition, meaning, pdf, torrent, etc.); (2) Vertical-Specific Negatives (e.g., for legal: salaries, law school, exam; for SaaS: open source, template if irrelevant); (3) Brand/Competitor Control Lists (block competitors in non-competitor campaigns; block your brand in generic acquisition campaigns if you want pure non-brand performance). ￼”,
“Match Type Strategy for Negatives: Use broad/phrase negatives to block concept families and exact negatives for precision. Broad negatives remove any query containing all the negative words in any order; phrase negatives remove queries containing the exact phrase in sequence; exact negatives only block that precise term. ￼ Rule: Start with broad/phrase for clearly unwanted concepts (free, cheap, salary, definition) and move to exact negatives only when you need to surgically remove a high-performing ad group’s conflicts without collateral damage.”,
“Query Mining Rules: Every search term review cadence (for active campaigns usually weekly), add negatives when: (a) term has spent ≥ 1–2× target CPA with zero conversions, and (b) the intent is clearly irrelevant or unqualified, not just early-funnel. For borderline intent (e.g., research-y queries) consider adding them as negatives only at ad group level or redirect them to content/remarketing campaigns.”,
“Location & Ambiguity Negatives: For cities with duplicated names (e.g., Halifax UK vs Halifax Canada), add negatives at geo level like “England”, “UK” or “Nova Scotia” depending on which you do NOT serve. ￼ For branded terms that overlap common nouns, maintain a brand-protection negative list applied to generic campaigns to avoid your brand leaking into non-brand reporting.”,
“Competitor & Brand Strategy: If you run dedicated competitor campaigns, add negative competitor terms to your generic acquisition campaigns to keep reporting clean and avoid cannibalization. Conversely, if you are not running competitor campaigns, consider account-wide competitor negatives to avoid paying for low-intent competitor-brand searches where conversion rates can be much lower and CPCs higher.”,
“Performance Safeguards: For accounts heavily using broad match, maintain a “Safety Net” negative list applied to all campaigns to continuously absorb recurring wasters as you discover them. If a specific n‑gram appears in ≥30–50 non-converting clicks across campaigns, promote it to safety net negatives (often at phrase-match negative). ￼”
],
“url_selection_logic”: [
“Relevance First: Google scores landing page experience as a major Quality Score component based on relevance, usefulness, and user behavior (bounce/engagement). ￼ Rule: For each keyword theme, choose the page whose H1, copy, and offers most directly answer the query. If the query is “CRM for law firms”, landing on a generic CRM homepage instead of a legal vertical page will harm ad relevance and LPE more than a slightly slower page ever will.”,
“Shortest Path to Conversion: For transactional searches, send users to the page where they can perform the primary action in ≤1–2 clicks: product detail page, quote request, booking form, or pricing page. Only send to homepage when you (a) genuinely can’t determine intent within product lines, or (b) for branded generic queries where homepage navigation is strong and widely used.”,
“Segmented Landing Pages: When one keyword theme supports several personas or use cases (e.g., “project management software” for architects vs marketing agencies), build separate persona landing pages and split ad groups once each segment has enough volume (≥100–200 clicks/month) to justify its own experience. This increases relevance and can materially lift Quality Score and conversion rates.”,
“Final URL Expansion Rules: When using RSAs with final URL expansion (especially in PMax and some automated setups), only enable when your site IA is very clean—no thin pages, no off-topic blog categories, clear product taxonomy. Otherwise, expansion can send users to irrelevant or low converting content. For tightly controlled B2B/SaaS lead-gen, prefer manual URL selection in Search and consider PMax for discovery only when you have good conversion tracking and exclusions. ￼”,
“A/B Testing Thresholds: Test landing pages per theme only when you can drive at least ~200–300 clicks per variant within a reasonable time frame and expect ≥20 conversions per variant; otherwise results will be too noisy. Use 50/50 split until significance; then promote the winner and retire the loser instead of stacking endless variants.”
],
“quality_score_factors”: [
“Three Core Components: Google’s Quality Score for Search (1–10, keyword level) is determined primarily by Expected CTR, Ad Relevance, and Landing Page Experience. ￼ Expected CTR is modeled vs competitors for similar auctions; Ad Relevance is how tightly your ad copy matches the keyword and query; Landing Page Experience is relevance, usability, and post-click engagement.”,
“Practical Weighting: Independent analyses suggest Expected CTR and LPE often weigh more heavily than ad relevance alone, but all three matter. ￼ Rule-of-thumb: If QS < 5, you almost always see at least one component rated “Below average”. Fix that specific component before worrying about bid levels.”,
“Account Structure Impact: Poorly structured ad groups (too many keywords, mixed intents) lead to broad, generic ads that lower ad relevance and CTR, which in turn lower QS. Search Engine Journal and Google docs repeatedly emphasize small, tightly themed ad groups as key to ad relevance. ￼”,
“Landing Page Experience Rules: Improve LPE by (a) aligning headlines with query and ad copy, (b) ensuring fast load speed and mobile optimization, (c) providing clear, unique content (not thin or duplicated), and (d) offering transparent information (pricing, contact details, trust signals). ￼ Avoid gating content behind intrusive popups on first visit; these can hurt both UX and LPE.”,
“Bid & QS Interaction: Quality Score is not a KPI but a diagnostic; still, higher QS often correlates with lower CPC for the same ad rank. Keyword-level QS below 4–5 on high-spend terms is often a sign to (a) refine match types and negatives, (b) split ad groups, (c) rework RSAs, or (d) move the term to a better landing page rather than simply raising bids.”
],
“query_matching_behavior”: [
“Close Variants Everywhere: All match types (exact, phrase, broad) match to close variants, including misspellings, abbreviations, stemmings, singular/plural forms, reordered words, implied terms, and paraphrases with the same meaning. Opt-out is not possible. ￼ Rule: Don’t try to build exhaustive keyword lists—use tight themes plus negatives instead.”,
“Priority of Similar Keywords: When multiple eligible keywords can match a query, Google typically prefers the one with the exact match type and highest Ad Rank, or the one most closely matching the query’s meaning within the same ad group, assuming equal ad rank. ￼ Practically: Having the same keyword in different match types within the same ad group will not inherently increase costs; Google chooses the closest match. But duplicate keywords across ad groups or campaigns with the same match type can compete and create routing unpredictability.”,
“Routing Conflicts & Control: To control which ad/ad group shows, avoid duplicating identical match-type keywords in multiple ad groups targeting the same geo and audience. Use campaign-level negative keywords to “force” routing (e.g., negative [brand] in non-brand campaigns, or city-specific negatives to keep city-focused campaigns from overlapping). ￼”,
“Broad Match Behavior: Broad match uses not just textual similarity but many contextual signals (user’s recent searches, landing page content, other keywords in ad group) to decide matches. ￼ Rule: Fill your ad group with only tightly related keywords; irrelevant broad match expansions often come from mixed-theme ad groups and weak negatives.”,
“Negative Keyword Priority: If a negative keyword at any level (ad group, campaign, shared list) matches a query, the ad will not serve, even if positive keywords match. Negative match types behave similarly to positive ones but in reverse; phrase negatives are often the safest for blocking unwanted themes without overblocking.”
],
“keyword_planner_best_practices”: [
“Directional, Not Gospel: Treat Keyword Planner’s volume and competition numbers as directional. It aggregates close variants and can hide low-volume yet highly commercial queries; Reddit and practitioner reports confirm Planner often shows “0” volume for queries that later get meaningful traffic when targeted. ￼ Rule: If a query clearly expresses strong buying intent, don’t discard it just because planner volume is low.”,
“Use Both ‘Discover’ and ‘Get Search Volume & Forecasts’: Use Discover new keywords to expand seed lists and Get search volume and forecasts to understand how combinations of keywords might perform at different spend levels. ￼ Use forecast curves to decide which themes can support separate campaigns (those that can reach your minimum conversions/month threshold).”,
“Refine Filters Aggressively: Apply location, language, and network filters before downloading data; ensure you’re aligning to the intended campaign territory and network (Search vs Search Network). ￼ Use Include/Exclude brand names, competitor names, and key modifiers (near me, free, cheap) to separate brand, competitor, and non-brand sets at the research stage.”,
“Cluster Inside Planner, Structure Outside: Planner’s Organize keywords into ad groups function is useful for quick clustering but should not be blindly turned into campaigns. ￼ Export grouped suggestions, review them in your master sheet, refine themes, and only then import as ad groups.”,
“Cost Modeling: Use plan forecasts to estimate whether a keyword set can generate the minimum 20–30 daily clicks or 30–50 monthly conversions needed to support its own bid strategy. ￼ Use different Target CPA or CPC scenarios to find break-even points and to justify to clients why certain keywords are excluded (too expensive for their target CPA at current conversion rates).”
],
“competitor_strategy”: [
“Dedicated Competitor Campaigns: Create separate campaigns for competitor-brand terms with their own budgets, bids, and messaging. This avoids competitor traffic distorting non-brand performance and lets you cap spend on what is usually lower CVR but high strategic value. ￼ Ad copy must differentiate and avoid trademark violations; focus on value comparison, switches, and risk mitigation (“Why [Your Brand] vs [Competitor]”).”,
“High-Intent Competitor Queries Only: Prioritize competitors’ terms that indicate switch or comparison intent (“alternative”, “vs”, “replacement”, “pricing”, “reviews”) rather than pure navigational queries like just the competitor brand name. ￼ Rule: If competitor campaign CPAs are >2–3× your non-brand CPA and LTV is not substantially higher for those users, cap budgets or restrict to comparison-modifier terms only.”,
“Competitor Keyword Exclusion: If you do not want to play the competitor bidding game, add key competitors as phrase or exact negatives to non-brand campaigns, especially when SERPs are dominated by the competitor’s brand traffic that rarely converts for you. Maintain a shared list for account-wide competitor negatives and review quarterly.”,
“Auction Insight & Gap Analysis: Regularly review Auction Insights to see which competitors appear most frequently in your auctions, and use Ahrefs/Semrush paid keyword reports to identify gaps where they bid and you don’t, and vice versa. ￼ Rule: Add gaps only when they align with your economic and intent criteria; don’t mirror competitors blindly.”,
“Competitor Audience Targeting: Beyond keyword conquesting, create custom audiences of users who visit competitor domains and target them in Search (observation), Display, YouTube, and PMax as higher-intent segments, as described in newer competitor audience guides. ￼ This allows conquesting without inflating CPC on competitor brand terms directly.”
],
“location_targeting_rules”: [
“Location Level Selection: Use the most efficient geo granularity for your spend: in descending order of general performance reliability: state/region, radius around locations, city, zip/postaI code, then DMA. ￼ For small budgets, avoid extremely granular targeting (hundreds of small zips) which fragments data; instead, use radius or city-level and analyze by location reports.”,
“Presence vs Interest Setting: For most local-service and national lead-gen advertisers, use Presence: People in or regularly in your targeted locations rather than Presence or interest; the latter includes people merely interested in the location, which can dilute lead quality. Multiple guides highlight the importance of checking these location options. ￼”,
“Budget & Geo Splitting: Split campaigns per region or city when you need (a) distinct budgets, (b) distinct bid strategies, or (c) significantly different CPL/ROAS profiles. Example threshold: If a city or region accounts for ≥30% of conversions with CVR ≥30% above or below account average, break it out as its own campaign with tailored bids, ad copy, and landing pages (e.g., localized testimonials, local numbers).”,
“City vs Country: For single-country advertisers, start with country-level campaigns and then refine using location bid adjustments or breakouts when you see performance pockets. For multi-country advertisers, always use separate campaigns per country (currency, language, competition, pricing, and regulations differ) and rarely combine different countries in one campaign. ￼”,
“Local Services Rule: For location-constrained service businesses (plumbers, dentists, home services), combine geo-modified keywords (“plumber near me”, “plumber ”) with geo targeting (cities/radii) and run Local/Performance Max campaigns to dominate local SERPs. ￼ Use negative keywords for other similarly named cities (e.g., Halifax) to prevent mis-matches. ￼”
],
“multi_language_account_rules”: [
“Separate Campaigns per Language: Best practice is to structure multi-language efforts with separate campaigns per language within each country to avoid cross-language keyword matching and to allow language-specific ads and extensions. ￼ Rule: Never mix multiple languages in the same search campaign in the same geo unless volume is tiny and you tightly control match types.”,
“Geo-Language Combinations: For markets with multiple languages (e.g., Switzerland, Belgium, Canada), create campaigns like “CH-DE-Search-NonBrand-Product”, “CH-FR-Search-Brand”, etc. Use language-specific keyword research (including local synonyms, dialects) and native-level copy. Ensure language targeting in campaign settings matches ad language.”,
“Shared vs Split Accounts: For complex global advertisers with many markets, you can use a single account with clear naming conventions for CC-Lang, or separate accounts by region if billing/ownership demands it. Use account structure guidelines to avoid mixing currencies and drastically different CPC markets in one bid strategy portfolio. ￼”,
“Localized Landing Pages: Never send non-English campaigns to English-only pages unless you are explicitly targeting bilingual users. Poor language alignment will crush CVR and LPE. Build or at least partially localize key landing pages before investing heavily in multi-language search.”,
“International Pitfalls: Before launching international campaigns, check language settings, time zones, currencies, and URL parameters to avoid wasted spend due to mis-targeting. International PPC guidance stresses mismatched currencies, targeting, and language as common, expensive mistakes. ￼”

“rsa_best_practices”: [
“Asset Volume & Diversity: Aim for 8–15 unique headlines and 3–4 unique descriptions per RSA. Google and independent sources recommend multiple, distinct messages rather than minor variations. ￼ Each headline should express a unique value prop, feature, proof point, or CTA; avoid repeating the same words across assets because ad strength and serving can suffer.”,
“Pinning Strategy: Pin only when absolutely necessary (e.g., for compliance or legal text). Over-pinning drastically reduces the number of combinations Google can test and can degrade ad strength. ￼ If you must pin, pin multiple variants to the same position (e.g., three alternative H1s pinned to position 1) so the system can still test. Avoid pinning more than ~30–40% of your headlines unless regulation demands it.”,
“Ad Strength as Diagnostic, Not Goal: Aim for at least Good ad strength for each RSA, but don’t chase Excellent at the cost of message clarity. Ad strength is a build-time indicator, not a direct auction factor, but it correlates with diversity and likely performance. ￼ If ad strength stays Poor even after adding unique assets, it may indicate too narrow a theme or too many pinned items.”,
“Intent Keyword Integration: Include main theme keywords in 2–4 headlines and at least one description per RSA to boost ad relevance and CTR; Google’s help docs recommend using ad text that includes keywords in ad group. ￼ Don’t keyword-stuff every headline; balance between keyword-heavy lines and benefit-driven/emotional lines.”,
“Testing Approach: In each ad group, run 1–2 RSAs with clearly different angles (e.g., Discount/Offer vs Social Proof vs Pain-Agitate-Solve). Use segmenting by asset and by combination to understand which headlines/descriptions drive performance, then recycle winning patterns into new RSAs across themes. Rotate tests only after at least 2–4 weeks and ≥1,000 impressions and ≥20–30 conversions per ad group when possible.”
],
“ad_copywriting_frameworks”: [
“Benefit-First, Feature-Second: CTR and QS improve when ads lead with benefits and outcomes rather than internal features. ￼ Framework: [Who] + [Core Benefit] + [Outcome]. Example for B2B SaaS: “Cut Billing Time by 50% – Cloud Invoicing Built for Agencies. Start 14-Day Trial.””,
“Intent-Aligned CTAs: Align CTAs with query intent stage. For TOFU/Informational keywords, use “Download Free Guide”, “See How It Works”, “View Pricing & Plans”. For BOFU/Transactional, use “Get Instant Quote”, “Book Same-Day Service”, “Start Free Trial”. Use clear, specific CTAs rather than generic “Click here”. ￼”,
“Message Matching Rule: Include the core keyword or its close variant in at least one headline and/or description. Studies on ad relevance show higher CTR when users see their query reflected in the ad. ￼ Use dynamic keyword insertion (DKI) sparingly for well-controlled themes, not on broad, mixed-intent groups.”,
“Emotional & Social Proof Layers: Combine rational proof (numbers, stats, guarantees) with emotional triggers (speed, safety, fear of loss, status). ￼ Example framework: H1 = Outcome, H2 = Social Proof, H3 = Risk Reversal. E.g., “Grow Leads 2x in 90 Days”, “Trusted by 4,000+ Clinics”, “Cancel Anytime – No Setup Fees.””,
“Specificity Threshold: When possible, use hard numbers instead of vague claims: “Save up to 30% on Energy Bills” beats “Save Money on Energy”. If you can’t legally commit to numbers, use precise qualifiers (“Same-Day Emergency Repairs”, “Results in 24 Hours”). High specificity increases perceived credibility and CTR.”,
“Copy Hygiene: Avoid repeating the same phrase across multiple headlines/descriptions in RSAs; Google may reduce serving if assets are too similar. ￼ Each asset should add new information (different benefit, feature, audience, or CTA).”
],
“keyword_clustering_methods”: [
“Manual Thematic Clustering: Start by grouping keywords around obvious semantic themes (product category, problem statement, audience segment, modifier). Use SERP intent and your site IA to check clusters. ￼ Rule: A cluster is valid if (a) one landing page can satisfy all queries and (b) one RSA can speak convincingly to at least 70–80% of queries in the cluster.”,
“N‑gram Performance Clustering: Export search terms, tokenize into n‑grams (1–3 words), and aggregate metrics by n‑gram to find profitable or wasteful sub-phrases. ￼ Promote n‑grams with strong performance (CVR ≥1.3× average, CPA ≤0.7× target) into dedicated ad groups or exact keywords; block poor-performing n‑grams as negatives.”,
“Vector/ML Clustering (When Volume Is Large): For accounts with tens of thousands of queries, use keyword embedding or clustering tools (like Pemavor or custom scripts) to group by semantic similarity. ￼ Export clusters with IDs and names (e.g., “pricing”, “enterprise”, “integration”) and map them to campaigns/ad groups that mirror your site’s structure.”,
“Funnel-Based Clustering: Overlay intent/funnel tags on your clusters: for each theme, mark keywords as TOFU/MOFU/BOFU. Run BOFU clusters in high-bid search campaigns; treat TOFU clusters as candidates for content, Display, or PMax asset groups instead of direct-response search where CVR will be weaker.”,
“City-Based vs Service-Based Clustering: For local service businesses operating in multiple cities, you can cluster (a) by service first (e.g., “plumbing”, “heating”, “AC”), then manage location via geo targeting and local ad copy, or (b) by city first (“Austin Plumbing”, “Dallas Plumbing”) when you need city-specific budgets and offers. Rule: Use service-based clustering when budget is limited and you don’t need city-level control; switch to city-based clustering when a city/region accounts for ≥20–30% of spend or requires its own promos/pricing. ￼”
],
“brand_vs_nonbrand_rules”: [
“Separate Campaigns as Default: Always split brand and non-brand into separate campaigns for clean reporting, budget control, and bid strategies. ￼ Brand terms typically have much higher CTR and CVR; combining them with non-brand masks the true cost of acquisition from cold traffic.”,
“Brand Strategy: Protect brand terms aggressively; maintain high impression share (>90%) on your own brand for core markets to prevent competitor conquesting and to control messaging. Bidding on your own brand, even with strong SEO rankings, improves SERP control and can significantly boost CTR vs organic alone. ￼”,
“Non-Brand Strategy: Use non-brand campaigns to scale acquisition, focusing on commercial and transactional keywords that describe problems and solutions, not your brand name. For non-brand search, be more selective on CPCs; require that forecasted CPA/ROAS meets your economic targets before scaling spend.”,
“Branded Negatives: In non-brand campaigns, add your brand (and common misspellings) as negative keywords to prevent cannibalization and maintain clean non-brand data. When running Performance Max or broad brand campaigns, you may need to accept some cross-contamination, but still use brand negatives in pure acquisition Search campaigns.”,
“Reporting Logic: Segment performance by brand vs non-brand at least monthly and by device and geo where relevant. Use brand performance as a “health” indicator (demand, retention), and non-brand performance as an acquisition efficiency indicator. Report them separately to clients so they understand that non-brand performance is the true acquisition cost from new cold audiences.”
],
“scaling_structure”: [
“Stage 1 – Foundation (1–3 Campaigns): Launch with Brand Search, one Non-Brand Core Search campaign (few tightly themed ad groups), and possibly a Remarketing or PMax campaign if you have existing traffic. Keep structure simple to hit 30–50 conversions per campaign quickly and to train Smart Bidding. ￼”,
“Stage 2 – Theme Expansion: Once Non-Brand Core delivers stable performance (≥30–50 conversions/month and meeting CPA/ROAS goals), expand by splitting high-volume themes into their own campaigns or ad groups (e.g., “Emergency”, “Installation”, “Maintenance” for HVAC). Add dedicated Competitor campaign if justified. Use DSA or broad match discovery campaigns to find new queries and feed back winners into core structure.”,
“Stage 3 – Geo & Persona Splits: When overall spend grows and regional or persona-level differences emerge (≥30% deviation in CPA/CVR and ≥20–30% of total spend), split campaigns by geo or persona. Local service guidance and international PPC best practices both support geo-based campaign splits for budget control and local messaging. ￼”,
“Stage 4 – Full Funnel & Automation: At larger scale, add PMax campaigns structured around product categories or value props, plus mid-funnel campaigns targeting commercial investigation queries and upper-funnel awareness via Display/YouTube. Use sophisticated audience strategies (remarketing lists, customer lists, competitor audiences) and value-based bidding (Target ROAS with LTV weighting). ￼”,
“Scale Guardrails: As you add campaigns and ad groups, keep an eye on: (a) average conversions per campaign/ad group (don’t let them fall below ~15/month), (b) proportion of traffic on exploratory vs proven themes (ideally 70–80% on known winners, 20–30% on tests), and (c) operational overhead—every new structure element should earn its existence via data or strategic need.”
],
“account_size_structuring”: [
“Small Accounts (≤€/$3k/month): Use minimal campaigns: Brand, one Non-Brand by core service/product, and Remarketing if traffic allows. Limit ad groups to core themes (3–8 per campaign). Avoid heavy segmentation by device, match type, or very granular geos. Use phrase and exact mostly; introduce broad only for highly controlled, high-intent themes with strong negatives.”,
“Medium Accounts (€/$3k–30k/month): Structure by product/service line and sometimes by geo region; maintain separate brand, non-brand, and competitor campaigns. Use more robust testing: 2–3 RSAs per ad group, landing page A/B tests on major themes, DSA/catch-all campaigns, and PMax for Shopping or multi-network reach. Data volume allows for some persona or funnel segmentation but avoid the temptation to over-split.”,
“Large/Enterprise Accounts (>€/$30k/month or multi-country): Use hierarchical structure: (a) campaigns per country and language, (b) within each, campaigns per product line/funnel stage, (c) ad groups by themes/personas. ￼ Use portfolio bid strategies, scripts, and tools to manage at scale. Consolidate where Smart Bidding needs more data—avoid hundreds of tiny campaigns.”,
“Agency Portfolio Logic: For agencies managing many small accounts, build a repeatable structural blueprint per vertical (e.g., for local services: Brand, Service-Core-Search, Emergency/High-Intent, PMax Local, Remarketing) to avoid reinventing the wheel while still leaving room for account-specific customizations. ￼”
],
“low_vs_high_volume_niche_rules”: [
“Low-Volume Niches (B2B, High-Ticket): Expect tiny search volumes with highly specific queries; most are long-tail or appear as zero volume in Keyword Planner. Treat Planner volumes as lower bounds. ￼ Strategies: (a) use phrase/exact for core terms, (b) embrace long-tail variations by including them directly as keywords, (c) rely heavily on DSA and broad-match discovery with strict negatives, and (d) augment with LinkedIn/Display/YouTube for demand creation because search alone may not scale.”,
“High-Volume Niches (Ecommerce, Local Services): Expect lots of overlapping and variant queries. Use clustering and n‑gram analysis to aggregate performance at phrase level and to decide where to split. ￼ Use broad and phrase with robust negatives to avoid building massive keyword lists. PMax with Shopping should often be a core channel for high-volume product catalogs. ￼”,
“Statistical Thresholds for Decisions: In low-volume niches, you must accept noisier data; make decisions based on longer time windows. Example: pause/negative a keyword only after ≥100 clicks and no conversions, or after 3–4× your target CPA in spend. In high-volume niches, you can act much faster; pause keywords after 1–2× target CPA in spend without conversions or after clear underperformance over hundreds of clicks.”,
“Structure for Low Volume: Consolidate heavily. Use fewer campaigns and fewer ad groups to ensure any given group sees enough clicks to learn. Avoid splitting by device, age, gender, or very granular geos unless there’s a legal or business necessity. Use observation audiences instead of targeting to collect signals.”,
“Structure for High Volume: Use more granular segmentation where it yields control and insight (by device, brand vs non-brand vs competitor, geo, and key product categories). But still align with Google’s advice on avoiding over-fragmentation; consolidation under common goals and themes will help AI bid strategies perform better. ￼”
],
“common_pitfalls_and_avoidance”: [
“Overly Complex Structures: Too many campaigns and ad groups with little data in each leads to under-trained Smart Bidding and noisy performance. Multiple guides and Google’s ABCs of Account Structure highlight this as a core mistake. ￼ Avoid device-only splits, micro-geos, and SKAGs unless there is clear, high-volume justification.”,
“Ignoring Conversion Tracking: Running Smart Bidding or evaluating ROI without accurate conversion tracking (including duplicate or missing events) is one of the most expensive PPC errors. ￼ Rule: No serious scaling or automation until conversion tracking is verified with test conversions and cross-checked against CRM/analytics.”,
“Bad Keyword Hygiene: Using overly broad, unqualified keywords without negatives (“marketing”, “software”, “jobs”) leads to poor relevance, high CPC, and wasted spend. ￼ Always include negative lists from day one and run weekly search term reviews in the first 90 days.”,
“Wrong Network & Location Settings: Accidentally targeting Search + Display or using Presence or interest location options for local businesses commonly wastes budget. ￼ Keep Search and Display separate, and use Presence for local lead-gen.”,
“Blindly Accepting Recommendations: Auto-apply recommendations (especially adding keywords, broad match, or new placements) without human review can destroy account economics, as practitioners and thought pieces warn. ￼ Use recommendations as prompts, not commands; evaluate each against intent mapping and economic thresholds.”,
“No Landing Page Focus: Sending all traffic to the homepage or low-relevance pages is a common mistake that harms Quality Score and CVR. ￼ Rule: For each major theme, create/assign a landing page with clear message match and single primary CTA.”
],
“agency_workflow”: [
“Phase 1 – Discovery & Intake: Gather business objectives, margin data, LTV, sales cycle length, offline conversion paths, and existing analytics. Identify primary and secondary conversions. Document product/service hierarchy, top geos, and customer personas. Use this to define initial KPIs and structure hypotheses. ￼”,
“Phase 2 – Research: (a) Keyword research via Keyword Planner, third-party tools, SERP analysis, and competitor research; (b) audience research (remarketing lists, customer lists, in-market segments); (c) competitive PPC analysis using Auction Insights and tools like Ahrefs/Semrush/SpyFu; (d) tracking audit. ￼ Output: Master keyword & intent sheet, competitor matrix, tracking/analytics plan.”,
“Phase 3 – Planning & Architecture: Design account structure (campaigns, ad groups, match types, negatives, audiences) following consolidation and intent rules. Set initial budgets and bid strategies per campaign based on forecasted volumes and target CPA/ROAS. ￼ Create naming conventions, shared negative lists, and audience lists.”,
“Phase 4 – Build: Implement campaigns, ad groups, keywords, negatives, RSAs, extensions, and landing page parameters. Set up conversion tracking (Google Tag, GA4, offline imports where needed) and verify using test conversions. Ensure all campaigns launch in Expert mode, Search-only when appropriate. ￼”,
“Phase 5 – QA & Soft Launch: Run a structured QA checklist: settings (locations, languages, networks), budgets, bid strategies, tracking, ad policies, URL checks. Launch with slightly conservative bids and budgets for 1–2 weeks of data gathering, avoiding over-optimization in first days. ￼”,
“Phase 6 – Optimization & Reporting: Weekly in first 60–90 days: search term mining, negative expansion, pausing non-performers, reallocating budget to best campaigns, testing new RSAs/landing pages, and adjusting bid strategies. Monthly: structural changes (splits/consolidations), expansion to new themes, and strategic reporting to clients (highlighting learning, tests, and ROI). ￼”
],
“client_facing_explanations”: [
“Simplified Visual Keyword Maps: Present keyword research not as raw spreadsheets but as (a) grouped themes (bubbles or treemaps) by intent and funnel stage, and (b) example queries per group. Practitioners recommend using visual groupings to avoid overwhelming non-technical stakeholders. ￼ Explain: “These are the core ways people look for you: Brand, Problem-Based, Solution-Based, Competitor, and Research. We’re prioritizing the ones closest to purchase.””,
“Economic Justification: Use Keyword Planner forecasts and third-party CPC/competition data to show why some attractive keywords are excluded or deprioritized. ￼ Example: “For ‘project management software’, forecast CPA is ~$450 at current CVR; your target is $200. We’ll first target more specific variants like ‘project management software for agencies’ where competition and CPCs are lower.””,
“Structure Explanation Framework: Explain account structure in business terms, not platform jargon: “We have Brand campaigns that protect your name, Non-Brand campaigns that capture new demand, Competitor campaigns that win switchers, and Remarketing campaigns that close the loop.” Show one slide per campaign type with objectives, KPIs, and example queries.”,
“Hypothesis-Driven Plans: Present keyword and structure decisions as testable hypotheses: “Hypothesis 1: Users searching ‘same day ’ are highly time-sensitive and will respond to premium pricing if we guarantee arrival times. To test this, we’ve given these terms their own ad group, landing page, and higher bid.” This frames the plan as measured experimentation, not guesswork.”,
“Expectation Setting: Explain that early months focus on learning and that structure may evolve as data accumulates: “We start consolidated so the algorithm learns faster; when we see clear winners or segments behaving differently, we split them into their own campaigns with dedicated budgets.” Tie this to Google’s own consolidation guidance. ￼”

“industry_specific_examples”: [
“Local Services (Plumber, Dentist, HVAC): Campaigns: (1) Brand Search (broad and phrase brand terms); (2) Service-Core Search (e.g., Plumbing, Heating, AC); (3) Emergency/High-Intent Search (keywords including “emergency”, “24/7”, “same day”); (4) PMax Local/Local Services Ads; (5) Remarketing. ￼ Ad groups by service + urgency (e.g., “Water-Heater-Install”, “Drain-Cleaning”, “Emergency-Plumber”). Location targeting: city or radius around office with Presence setting. Negatives: DIY, jobs, salaries, brands of unrelated equipment.”,
“Ecommerce Retail: Campaigns: (1) Shopping/PMax by product category (e.g., “Running-Shoes”, “Trail-Shoes”), (2) Non-Brand Search by category & intent (“women’s running shoes”, “stability running shoes for flat feet”), (3) Brand Search, (4) Competitor Brand Search (if profitable), (5) Remarketing/Display. ￼ Ad groups: cluster by subcategory or audience (men/women/kids). Keywords: mix of broad and phrase anchored on product type + key modifiers (size, color, use-case). Landing pages: direct to category or product listing pages with filters pre-selected when possible.”,
“B2B SaaS: Campaigns: (1) Brand, (2) High-Intent Product Search (e.g., “subscription billing software”, “b2b appointment scheduling software”), (3) Problem-Aware Search (“reduce churn”, “automate invoicing”), (4) Competitor, (5) Remarketing/ABM. ￼ Ad groups by vertical (“CRM for Lawyers”, “CRM for Agencies”), by use-case (“Churn-Reduction”, “Automation”), or by funnel stage (trial vs demo). Match types: phrase and exact for core; selective broad for discovery with strong negatives. Landing pages: persona- and vertical-specific, optimized for demo/trial requests.”,
“Multi-Location Retail or Franchises: Campaigns: separate per region/state or per high-density city to enable local budgets and messaging. For each region: (1) Brand, (2) Store/Location Search (“ near me”, “ ”), (3) Product/Category Search, (4) Local PMax. ￼ Ad groups often split by store clusters and major product categories. Location extensions and local inventory ads are key. Negatives for irrelevant locations (same city names in different states/countries).”,
“Professional Services (Law, Medical): Campaigns: (1) Brand, (2) Practice-Area Search (“personal injury lawyer ”), (3) High-Intent Modifiers (“contingency fee lawyer”, “same day appointment”), (4) Competitor if justified, (5) Remarketing. Use restrictive geo targeting (city/radius) and Presence setting. Ad copy heavily emphasizes expertise, locality, reviews, and risk reduction. Landing pages: separate pages for each practice area and city, with strong trust signals and clear intake forms.”,
“Lead-Gen for High-Ticket B2B (Consulting/Industrial): Expect very low volumes; structure as (1) Brand, (2) Core Non-Brand themes (3–5 ad groups), (3) Competitor, (4) Informational DSA for content downloads. Heavy reliance on exact/phrase; broad with strong negatives for discovery. Multi-step qualification (lead scoring, offline conversion import) is essential to guide Smart Bidding because lead volume is small but deal value is high. ￼”
