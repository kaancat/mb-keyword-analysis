# 1.6 Complimentary AdVenture Media Account Audit (exclusions apply)

Howdy, Edwards fans.And welcome back.Good morning.I want to talk to you very briefly about an exceedingly successful program that we started running afew months ago here at Adventure Media.This is actually our main office here in New York.It's pretty early.The team members haven't started shuffling in yet, but they will soon.But it's where we offer students a complimentary 30 minute PPC campaign audit.That means we want either myself or one of our PPC account specialists will be with you on the phonefor 30 minutes, 45 minutes, going through your actual account, pointing out where that account couldbe improved if you're struggling with conversion tracking or you're working on keyword lists or justoverall broader strategy, trying to expand into new areas of services, products, whatever it maybe, we'll get into that account with you over a screen share and we'll talk with you and give you actualpractical advice that you could take away, implement in your campaigns and see an increase in performancebecause of it.Now, again, of course, you're learning all these techniques, but there's something to be said abouthaving somebody personally actually look at your individual specific campaign, your account, and reallytalk with you about that specific struggles and the specific areas of your campaigns that could useimprovement.So that's what this audit is.It's done either through screen share or it's done just by talking over the phone.But the important thing is you do need to give us access to the account.There's two ways that you could do that.The ideal way is going to be with your ten digit customer ID number.So you're going to click on the link that I'm going to put in the description of this lecture.That link is going to bring you to a landing page where you're going to be able to submit that requestfor one of us to give you that audit in one of the forms.We're going to ask you in one of the fields of the form, we're going to ask you for your ten, tendigit customer ID number, which is located in the upper right hand corner of your AdWords dashboard.If you're using the old version of AdWords, I'm going to give you images and instructions to find yourattention to customer ID number.Once we have that, we're going to we can't do anything with the ten digit customer ID number.We will send you an access request.We'll use that ten digit customer ID number to link to our agency account.That way, once you accept that request, we'll be able to go into the campaigns and actually see what'sgoing on in there.Again, if your boss or you are not comfortable with giving out the tentative customer ID number andhaving us access the account that way, because that that is agency, it's an agency management link.That's really how we do 99% of these audits, 99% of prospects at the company is done that way.But you could also send an access request via email.So if you have to do it that way, just put in a random ten digit customer ID number into the form andthen just mention that you need to send us email access and we'll get in touch with you for the rightway to do it.So the audit is going to be exciting.Again, we'll talk about analytics.We'll talk about conversion tracking.We'll talk about new keyword ideas, match types, ad copy, landing pages, you name it.If it's something that we point out or we see in the campaigns that could use improvement, we're goingto work with you on that.It's completely free.We're not charging you for this.And the reason why we do it is twofold.One is I genuinely like looking at average campaigns.I like analyzing these these business problems.It's fun for me and it's fun for the people here that work here.So it's a it's a great thing.It's great for us.It's great for you.It also adds value.Know you're a student.That's the thing that I appreciate and it adds a lot of value.And of course, hopefully the idea is you'll see that the company we have here is a really world classgroup of the best digital managers that I have ever seen that I have ever worked with.And I think you'll see that level of sophistication and intelligence on the phone.And listen, worst comes to worst.You take the the advice and the insight, you go your way.But who knows?Maybe we could work together.Maybe you'll see value in having us actively manage these campaigns, increase performance over time.The how is again, you're going to fill out the form on the page that's going to be linked.I'm going to add a link in the description, fill out that page.Also, there's a bunch of additional frequently frequently asked questions, FAQs on that page.And you'll be able to we'll get in touch with you very shortly.A couple of things to note in order.We get a lot of requests.I mean, we have I don't know what it is, 70,000 students.We get lots and lots of requests every day for these audits.First, keep in mind that your account needs to be spending between five and 10,000 minimum a monthto five and 10,000 USD minimum a month.That has to be your minimum budget.Five, 7000.That's really the cutoff cut off.Line it.Has to be spending that kind of money for at least the last two months, let's say.I used to you know, we say three months to three months.It basically cannot be a new account.We can't really help new accounts improve performance because there's just not enough data.It's not a personal thing.It's not because, you know, you're not going to be a good client if you're not spending a lot of money.That's not how it is.That's not how we operate.It's just that we know from experience that we're not going to be as effective the if we're not if wedon't have enough data to look at and we don't have enough data to analyze.So that's completely why.Other than that, that's basically it.I wanted to make you aware of this program, this complimentary audit.I encourage you 100% to take advantage of it.And if you get me on the phone, fantastic.I'm looking forward to speaking to you.But whoever you get from our team on the phone, it's they're going to bring an enormous amount of insight.And I guarantee that when you leave that call, you will have specific, actionable and practical,practical advice that you could implement in your campaigns right away that will result in an increasein performance.So I look forward to hearing from you.And with that, we will jump into the next lecture.
