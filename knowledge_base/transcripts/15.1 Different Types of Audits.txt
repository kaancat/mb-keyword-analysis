# 15.1 Different Types of Audits

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about three different types of audits.Just so you understand going into an audit of a new campaign, what type of audit you want to focuson.And this is going to be determined based on what your client is looking for.If you're pitching a new account, if it's your boss, if it's your own, um, if it's your own account,none of these three audits are better or worse than the others, but they all sort of focus on differentthings.And you want to just determine what type of report or conversation are you preparing for.And of course, ideally you would look at and do all three of these types of audits.So let me walk you through high level.These individual audit strategies.And then we're going to talk about a our Adventure Media audit cheat sheet.Number one is your quick wins audit.These are the most apparent optimizations that really should have been addressed yesterday.These are the immediate impactful actions that show noticeable results in a short time.These are like looking at how many keywords are driving zero impressions.Or I'm sorry, zero conversions.How much money is being wasted from clearly bad, um, ad groups or lack of negative keywords?Um, things like that.This type of quick wins audit.It's great for showcasing progress and getting client confidence right off the bat.And quick wins will typically include best practices for advertising, and they will set the stage formore complex strategies to come later.So a few other examples of quick wins.Whether it's like, okay, your budget is severely restricted and your best performing campaign or youhaven't added.You haven't added any negative keywords in a year.Or here's like 12 search terms that are eating up 40% of your budget that haven't driven a conversion.You only have, um, two out of 15 headlines written in your ads.Your descriptions are half the character length, so you don't have conversion tracking set up.You're sending your ads to the wrong landing pages.You're missing out on traffic to these other landing pages on your site, etc., etc. there's issueswith your merchant center feed, right?Those are the clear and present warnings.A list of the best practices that are immediately addressable and will have a big impact on the campaign.Number two is a strategic audit.A strategic audit addresses how our performance media philosophy will help the business exceed its goals.This is more of a planned approach for researchers researching specific goals, blending short termactions with a long term vision.A strategic audit is going to analyze market trends, competition, historical data, client strengthsand weaknesses, and managing potential risks.Remember, think of it like a story.So in a strategic audit we would start off with a Swot analysis.What are the strengths the weaknesses in a business.We're going to look at the quick wins.But we're also going to look at is there a testing framework in this account.What types of tests might we want to run.What are the short term and long term goals of the business?What is your business all about?What are you looking to accomplish?Are you looking to gain market share?Are you looking to gain more revenue?Are you looking to protect margin?A strategic audit looks at.Is the account set up, even if there were no quick wins?But is the account structured in a way that is going to meet your goals?Will it put your business on a path to meeting your goals?And a strategic audit is, I would say, the sweet spot where you're looking at some quick wins, butyou're not relying on quick wins to get a a health check.You're looking at is there a match between where I want to go as a business?What I'm looking to accomplish that might be generate X amount of leads, and then if a client or yousay, hey, I don't really know, okay.It's just more business.Well that's not good enough.You're getting X amount of leads.You're getting 100 leads a month.Now in six months from now, set a target 200 leads a month.Okay.Well, what does your CPA should be?And here's how much you should spend.And here's what your campaign structure needs to look like.Um, that's a strategic audit.And then an optimization audit is a blueprint of day to day optimizations to reach business goals andreduce that wasted ad spend.So the quick wins looks at things to avoid optimizations, looks at new things to do, and the strategicaudit looks at is the campaign set up aligned so in the optimizations.Audit troubleshooting optimizations done on a daily basis.So this is like okay we should be adding negative keywords.We should be looking addressing budgets.We should be looking at our metrics that matter report.We should be analyzing site link extension performance.We should be creating new audiences and segments.And then comparing that performance period over period to help reduce wasted ad spend, understand changesin market dynamics and adjust settings in real time.That's an optimizations audit.Now the best audit.If you're an agency pitching an account, the best audit is going to incorporate all three of thesethings.Quick wins strategy and looking forward based on strategy.Here are the optimizations that we think need to be made on a daily basis to hit your targets.And I think that instead of just going around and doing like an audit, going through the entire campaign,being able to look at each of these individual things in buckets is really helpful for you.Staying on track and organizing and getting a sense, an orientation with what you're looking at andwhat information is coming into your head and how you're synthesizing and translating that, that information.So when I do an audit, I say, okay, I see this issue with a campaign setting.That's a quick win.That's something that I need, I need to change so I can make a list of all the things I have to changetomorrow.Then I might say, do I understand the strategy here?Do I understand what this account is trying to accomplish?Sure, I know it's about getting more sales and getting more leads and whatever it is.But like to what end?What are the goals and how long of a period of time should we be aiming to accomplish this?That's going to allow me to think about budget, that's going to allow me to think about bidding strategy,that's going to allow me to think about testing frameworks, that's going to allow me to think aboutwhether I should even be focusing on writing new ads or not, like it's going to.The strategic audit is really important.And then optimization says, okay, moving forward for the next year, for the next six months, whatdo I want to be doing on a daily, weekly and monthly basis?So these are three audit categories.Collectively they make a very powerful audit.Um, in the next lecture we're going to talk about our guide to actually running a Google Ads audit.I'll see you shortly.
