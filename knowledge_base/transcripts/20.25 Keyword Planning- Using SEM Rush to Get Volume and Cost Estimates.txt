# 20.25 Keyword Planning- Using SEM Rush to Get Volume and Cost Estimates

Howdy, Google Ads fans.And welcome back.As you can tell, I have a little bit of a cold, but we're going to push through nonetheless.And with a lot of tea and fluids and a lot of medicine, hopefully we'll be able to get through a bunchof exciting lectures and keep up our good spirits.So in this lecture, we're going to continue on talking about keyword planning, sort of getting intokeyword organization.And we're going to use a couple of different tools I want to show you in this lecture in the next one,Sam Rush.Sam Rush, which is the tool that we use at our agency most frequently.There are other tools out there like Spy Fu and Keyword Spy.I'm sure you guys have heard a lot of these.Russia is a really good one.It gets a lot of good data.All this data that Sam Rush pulls, it's really pulled from Google's APIs.So the Google keyword planner, there's a lot of overlap between the two tools.And of course, Sam Rush doesn't have a native integration back into your campaigns with Google, asdoes the Google keyword planner.So there are advantages.There are advantages to the Google keyword planner, but there are also a lot of really good competitiveanalysis features in Sam Rush that the Google keyword planner doesn't have.So I recommend checking out Sam Rush.Sam Rush is a paid software.So I think the I think the agency price that we're paying, it's a few hundred dollars a month, butthey certainly have cheaper pricing.I don't know exactly what it is at the time that you're looking at this, but right now, I think there'sa plan for 40 or $49 a month or something like that, and you get a lot of different.There's also a free version.There's a free version that gives you a limited amount of data so it's not useless.You definitely start off with the free version and if you like it and if it's sort of helpful, thendefinitely consider getting a paid version and use it regularly.It's really, really good if you have to choose between something like SIM Russian Optimizer.We've spoken about Optimizer in the past and we're going to talk about Optimizer more later on in thecourse.I definitely recommend going with Optimizer.Optimizer is not a research tool.It's a tool that helps you manage your account and gets your account more profitable.A lot of what you do in SEM could be done manually and you could get a lot of it from the Google keywordplanner, like I said, for free.So if it's if budget is an issue and there's a limited amount of money to spend and you had to choosebetween, let's say, one of those two types of software, I want to point out that they're distinctlydifferent.Softwares like Optimizer is a really good thing to have for managing account at scale and saving youa lot of time and getting a lot of insights into campaigns like negative keyword ideas.The keyword sculptor, which I showed you, AB testing tools for ads and things like that, and I don'tget paid by either Optimizer or Sam Rush.I'm not an affiliate.I have no affiliation.I mean, I'm friends with the owner of Optimizer, but certainly I don't know.I've never met anybody from Sam Rush.I have nothing to do with them and I certainly don't get paid from anybody.So let's jump into the computer.Let's go into Sam Rush and let's take a look to see if we can get some traffic estimates, some costestimates and some keyword ideas.So here we are in the Sam Rush dashboard.And when you log in, you'll usually be in the in either the competitive research dashboard or the bigpicture tools.And this left hand menu over here is a selection of all the different categories of tools and analysisthat you can do in Sam Rush We're in advertising, and I spend almost all my time here under advertisingand advertising research, and we'll go through a few of these different tools.So we're going to start off in positions.And if you do click on advertising research originally, you'll get put in this page where you basicallyhave a search box at the top to start typing things in.So we can either type in the URL of a competitor, we can type in our own URL to see what Sam Rush hasfor us.But we're building out a campaign for office chairs, desk chairs for popping.And we want to start getting some keyword ideas, see what Sam Rush has to offer us.So I'm just going to simply start and start off by searching for office chairs up here in the searchbar search box.So office chairs and click search.And this brings you to the key word overview, which reads that we're looking at keywords and this bringsus to the keyword overview tool in SEM.And at the top is if you see a few different things, one on the upper right hand side over here, yousee a trend has the keyword in volume increased or decreased month over month.CPC distribution shows US per country, which is the most expensive cost per click.So we see that top US has an average cost per click of $4.23.Now, remember, these are estimates, these are not exact.This is not real data, this is not live data.Even though it says a live update, it's algorithmically guessed volume 135 K that's telling you thenumber of monthly searches that that.Takes place for the keyword.And this is again a prediction.It could be totally, totally off page search, CPC competition, competition one meaning it's a veryhighly competitive word.Now, down here, we're gonna get into some more interesting things.One we see phrase match keywords, phrase match keywords means other keywords that are being searchedfor on search engines, namely Google and Bing, but really primarily Google that include my root keywordthat include office chairs in that order.So IKEA office chair, Staples office chair, go and see the full report.Related keywords are more like it's more like a broad match output.It's not exactly the keyword that you've searched for, but the search will give you other related keywordideas like desk chair.Right?Desk chair is not a phrase match version.There's nothing.It doesn't include my original search for office chairs.Scrolling down a little bit further, Sam gives you an output of ad copy that's showing up on Googlefor this search, which is fantastic product listing, ad copy down here for shopping ads and organicresults, which is really cool.So you can go and analyze it and see sort of what's been happening and you can get a sense of whichcompetitors are actually running ads and running campaigns for that search.But I'll show you that we'll go through how to look at competitors and Sam Rush in a little bit.So what I want to do, though, is I want to start getting keyword ideas so I'm more interested in herephrase match keywords and related keywords.And there's a number this number indicates how many suggestions they have.So the first thing I want to do is look at the full report so I can get more information.So click full report.And it looks like SMERSH recently moved that tool to this new tool called Keyword Magic, which is fine,and we'll click view report in keyword magic and that will load up the keyword magic tool.And it's the same exact thing as it always was before.So first again, I have my route keyword that I'm searching office chairs.I could click this tab here and add a new cube.So let's say I want to get ideas for ergonomic, ergonomic chairs because that's going to be one ofmy ADD groups and that's going to be one of the themes.We'll talk about themes in a couple of lectures and I can get a search for that.But let's go back to office chairs and analyze what's going on here.So first of all, we can change the location, toggle from us to a different state.And this is depending on the paid plan.Since we're in the US, I want to get the most accurate reporting for the United States.I could also toggle my match type so I could say show me ideas for phrase match abroad match, exactmatch or related.So if I go to broad match, I'll start seeing different search terms that don't necessarily containoffice match office chairs.But let's go back to phrase match.It shows me a total volume of the keywords in this report, the average difficulty level.I can add them to the keyword analyzer, which is similar to that thing where you build a plan in Googleand Google keyword plan and the Google keyword planner or I could export them.That's the most useful thing.I like to export things and sort of mess around with them in Excel and get ideas over there.So again, I would first start using this report at the most basic level to get ideas for positive andnegative keywords that I might not have thought so that I might not have figured out yet.And this sort of overlaps with that, with the keyword research stage that we were talking about.So you have we had ergonomic, we had wheeled, we had luxury, we had wooden, we had plastic, wehad colorful.We have all these different keyword themes, keyword ideas, and we're getting negative keywords, ideas,ideas as well, big and tall office chairs.Is that a cue that we want to have positive or negative office guest guest chairs?I guess that's an interesting theme.I haven't really thought about that.A few thousand searches a month that could certainly if I'm selling if we sell office chairs that arethat are sort of good for waiting rooms and things like that, that might be really good near me.That's somebody probably looking for a local store.So we would want to add near me as a negative.So and a lot of these ideas obviously we've had already and you're going to see a lot of overlap.But it's good to use multiple research tools because here's La-Z-Boy.La-Z-Boy is a company.I don't think we've run across La-Z-Boy before.So this is a new search term that could either be a new positive keyword that I haven't thought of already,or it could be a negative keyword.Keyword if if we check out La-Z-Boy is offering and we say, hey, either we're not running a competitorcampaign right now or we want to run La-Z-Boy or we or we don't sell the products similar to La-Z-Boy,let's say.So anybody is searching for a La-Z-Boy chair would not be a candidate for popping.Then we would add that as a negative keyword.But scrolling down here at the most basic level, you're going to get positive and negative keywordideas.You can sort this report by volume.You can sort by trend if how consistent has been over time by keyword difficulty, estimated cost perclick the competitiveness of the keyword, the number of SERP feature search engine results page features.So if it's just text ads or text and shopping ads, which is also interesting, if you want to knowwhich keywords also get Google shopping ads to show up, that's a feature you could use and resultsin the SERP, the number of actual results in the search engine results page for given keywords.So again, these are all predictions like when clients ask us and clients are going to ask you, canyou predict how much this keyword is going to cost us, how much volume this keyword is going to have?It's impossible, even though even if you're using them or even if you're looking at this data.I've seen many, many times I've seen a keyword with a rush CPC estimate of $1.50 and that keyword endsup costing $7 a click, even with a high quality score because there's a lot of other variables.That's your your competition, it's your website, it's your quality score, it's your bidding strategy.There's a lot of variables that go into it.These are just estimates.Google's not actually giving us the access to to their clients AdWords accounts, to advertisers accounts.So that's really cool.Now, in this left hand column, you could actually look at themes.So Ergonomic has 311 keywords, and if I click Ergonomic, it's going to filter this report to onlyshow me keywords that have the word ergonomic in it and show me again volume estimates.And this is a really, really helpful tool in SEM rush because themes is how we're going to structureour ad groups.Now, whether you're an e-commerce company selling products like Pop It Is or you're a service company.And in a couple of lectures, I'm going to walk you through an Excel exercise with both an eCommerceand a service business.As company, you could use these themes that that are sort of aggregates as ideas for ad groups.So if I see that ergonomic has a lot of volume and a lot of suggested keywords, I could use ergonomicoffice chairs not only to get ideas for that ad group, but also to figure out how I want to structuremy campaigns.Home Executive Cheap Leather Sale Back.So if I click on back, I want to get a sense of what are some of what are some of these ideas?Best office chairs for back support often shares for bad backs.Relax the backs.Office chairs.Right.So these are fantastic keyword ideas that we might not have thought of.We maybe we knew that we needed a lumbar support or back related ad group, but maybe we didn't realizethat office chairs for bad backs is a good search.Relax.The back office chairs is a good search.Best office chairs for your back.These are all really good ideas.Now, say I wanted to build out this back related ad group and I want to be able to analyze these keywordsor move them around or copy and paste them in in better areas.And by the way, if you twirl down back, you'll get an additional breakdown of keywords that are evenmore granular.But I don't think you you need to do that.Typically, looking at the top level aggregations or the top level groups or what I would call theseor themes is good enough.So now I could export these 4130 search terms into Excel, but say I only want to export keywords thatI know are going to be effective.So I could actually filter things out here.So I could click advance filters, say I want to exclude keywords that contain the word free.OC.Or cheap because these are going to be negatives.So I could do that.All right.So I've already knocked out 50 or so thousand keywords.I'm still I still have 200,000 keywords, and that's way too many.I could start knocking out keywords that have the competition.I could start knocking out keywords that have other modifiers that that I know are not going to be goodfor me.I could also only look at keywords that have a certain amount of volume, so maybe I don't want to evenlook at keywords at this point in my account that have less than an average monthly search volume of1000 searches.Right.So I'll do from 1000.And click enter.And I knocked out around 100,000 keywords right there.If I want to take a look at only keywords that have 5000 or more monthly searches.I'm not out to 54,000 keywords.So before exporting to excel, I could actually take a look at some advanced filters if I only wantto export the keywords that are going to be relevant to me.And there's a few things we could do with these advanced filters.So I see over here that there is 9065 keywords.That's the total number of keyword suggestions I have based on these filters, which basically justincludes phrase, match and my keyword.If I were to if I were to switch to, let's say broad match, I would see that number go up.Once I've switched to broad match, I have 37,000 keywords because I'm using office chairs, but I'mnot limiting any of these keywords to suggestions to requiring this phrase to be in that keyword.So let's go back to.Phrase match.And we're going to look at some filters before we export into Excel.So I'm go to advanced filters and let's say I want to exclude keywords that have the word free in thembecause I know that that's not something that I want to ever put into my account.So I'll click, I'll type in free under exclude, broad match free and click enter cheap.Discount.Let's just say as an example, maybe we would have to scan.Okay.So we've excluded around 1000 or so keywords off the bat, but now let's say I only want to look atkeywords that have a certain amount of monthly volume.So I have 8728 keywords.I know that's going to be too many for me.And I want to say, okay, you know, I'm not going to start analyzing keywords unless they have atleast 1000 monthly searches.So volume from I'll type in 1000, click enter.And these are actual filters that I would use.I'm not just giving random suggestions and I see that there's now 29 keywords left, right?So I went from from 8000 plus to 29 keywords that Rush is suggesting that I have that has more than1000 at least 1000 monthly searches.And maybe that's too much.Maybe we should do 500 volumes, 500 search term volume limit, which gives me 46.So that might be okay.Now we can start off with these 46, make sure that I'm really capitalizing on these main opportunities.If I think it's too low, I can go into broad match and see, okay, maybe broad match will give mesome more ideas.Now I have 184, so that might be something really worthwhile.Now that I have 184 of these keyword ideas for office chairs, let's go ahead and export this list sowe can click export all of these.I can also just select a group.So if I go back to let's say we're going to look at back.And again, it's going to follow the same amount, the filter.So I have ten keywords that have at least 500 monthly searches.And usually, by the way, I would I would say that the average monthly searches could be ten timesmore than Sam Rush is expecting, and I think that would even be a fair prediction.So if like if Sam tells you that there's 100 monthly searches, there could be at least 1000 monthlysearches, if not more, if not 50 to 100 times more.And it all depends, right?Sam are typically severely underestimates the volume, the monthly volume for any given keyword.So we're going to go back and we'll now click export and I can just select this group, right?This group which is back and I'll be only exporting the, the keywords that have that were suggestedunder the back category of the back theme.But if I want to export the entire list, I'll just click all and I'll export it as a CSV.It'll download and then I can open it up in Excel.And I have it right here.I could zoom in and I get all this great stuff.I get the actual keyword, I get the volume, I get the keyword, difficulty score, the predicted CPCcompetitiveness, the amount of results which I don't need.I don't really need these trends.I would delete these columns before start and I would competitive density.I don't really look at either too much, but here we go so I can see some CPC.And again the CPC and volume could be looked at contextually and that's when it could actually be useful.So for example, if I see that the search term office chair has 165,000 estimated monthly searches andleather office chair has 8100.I could be I don't know if these are the actual numbers.Maybe office chair has a million monthly searches or 2 million monthly searches, and it probably does.But I also but what I could be confident is that the search term for office chair has significantlymore search volume than leather office chair.Right.So when you look at these things contextually, internally against each other, that's when the datafrom SMBs could be really, really helpful.So anything goes for CPC, best office chair is assumed to be a dollar 11.Office chair by itself is assumed to be $3.85.So you could reasonably assume that office chair is going to be a more expensive click than best officechair.That's not as much of a rule than the volume than than the accuracy of comparing the volume with onekey to another.But it's it's most of the time that's the case.Most of the time it'll it'll be more expensive if it's telling you it's more expensive than anotherkeyword according to the data.But again, like office chair could be $7 a click, could be a dollar click.Right.You just don't know.These really are these really are just guesses.Now we're back in Russia.And in the next lecture, I'm going to show you a couple more things with regards to getting keywordideas through the SMS tools, but also how to look for keyword ideas, cost and volume estimates usingyour competitors.So I look forward to seeing you guys there soon in a couple of seconds.
