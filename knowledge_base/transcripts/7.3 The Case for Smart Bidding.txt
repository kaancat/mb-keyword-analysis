# 7.3 The Case for Smart Bidding

Welcome back.Let's talk about the case for smart bidding.On the left, you'll see what looks like a Rubik's Cube.And each colored box indicates what we call a signal.When you're using any of the automated bidding strategies, what we call smart bidding strategies,whether it's target, CPA, target, Roas, you're still having Google set unique bid bids for everyindividual auction.But these modern smart campaigns are using a combination of thousands of signals that we don't otherwisehave access for, to set the best bid placement and even creative combination.Those data points are what we call signals.So time of day location A user's previous search queries, the device that they're currently on, theoperating system that they're on, their interest categories, the videos that they've watched on YouTube,All of those data points are signals.Now, when we're setting up a Google Ads campaign, we can't necessarily go and make a bid adjustmentfor a certain operating system or make a bid adjustment for a certain time of day.But even if we could, that's not that wouldn't be the power that you're unlocking when you're usingsmart bidding.Even if I could make a bit of adjustment for time of day, which I can, or bid adjustments for locationor bid adjustments for previous YouTube videos, a certain user watched within the last hour, whichyou cannot do, but even if you could.This is all happening in real time, so Google might understand about a certain user that when thatuser is watching YouTube videos, they tend to buy something within the next hour.Other users who don't watch YouTube in the previous hour are not buying things, or they understandthat certain viewers who are browsing and reading certain websites are more likely to be in the marketfor a certain product, and they're making those associations not by gut instinct, not because somebodywho's a subscriber of Vogue magazine is likely to be in the in the in the market for a designer handbag.They might be making associations that somebody reading Vogue magazine is in the market for a leatherhorse saddle, like totally random associations, because they're just trusting the data.They have enormous amounts of data that they're able to use in real time.And all of those different data points are what we call signal signals.Who according to Google, there's over 100,000 of these individual unique data points that they're leveragingwhen you're using smart bidding.And we've seen the results, by and large, smart bidding absolutely outperforms manual bidding, whichis not to say that that's a rule, but it's definitely a general guideline.Our agency here at Adventure Media, we are very strong advocates for smart bidding.Our CEO, Patrick Gilbert, wrote a book about it.It was a bestselling book, and we leveraged automation as much as possible.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about a potential case and an argument to be made for manualbidding.
