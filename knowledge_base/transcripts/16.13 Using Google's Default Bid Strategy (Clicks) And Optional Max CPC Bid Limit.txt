# 16.13 Using Google's Default Bid Strategy (Clicks) And Optional Max CPC Bid Limit

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this group of lectures, we're going to be covering bidding strategies.It's complicated.There's a lot going on.There's a lot to learn about.But we're going to take it piece by piece and you could skip around to what you don't know on in yourown way.So when you get into the bidding section here, back in our Google ads interface, Google by defaultsays that you want to focus on clicks and fine.At first glance that doesn't seem so harmful and then it offers you a maximum CPC bid limit.This is one of the most egregious cases of Google recommending something so horrendously bad for you.There's a few different types of bidding strategies.Each one we're going to cover, there's autonomous bidding, semi-autonomous bidding.So semi-autonomous bidding and manual bidding.I highly recommend in most cases to begin with, manual bidding and then switch to certain types ofautonomous bidding.For example, focusing on your cost per conversion or focusing on return, on ad spend or focusing onconversions.Those are different things worth testing.Google's Autonomous Option of maximize clicks.It's really bad and you guys should be able to figure out why that is.One is that it's focusing on a metric that is not important to what what is the goal of advertisingprofit clicks or the amount of clicks you get doesn't have really much.It has a very, very distant relationship with ultimate profit conversions, cost per conversion, returnon ad spend.Even better, those all have direct relationships with profit.The amount of clicks you get do not.And it's very important to understand how much you want to pay for a click, the maximum you're willingto pay for a click.Now, when Google offers you this maximized clicks bidding strategy, all that means is that Googleis going to try to get the maximum amount of clicks for your daily budget.So if you have a daily budget of $1,000, you have no idea how many clicks you're going to get.You might get ten clicks, you might get 100 clicks, you might get five clicks, you might get 10,000clicks.You have don't you just don't know.Like Google is really taking over the bidding, but it's really like I said, you really should havesome control over what you're paying for.Click.Now you have this option of a maximum CPC bid limit, which is great.And if you hover over this little tool tip maximum CPC bid limit, bid limit is an advanced option.It's not an advanced option.You're just basically telling Google, no, you cannot recklessly spend my budget however you want to.Right.I'm not going for that.And while I'm giving you a lot of rhetoric, the truth is we've run many, many tests.And when you choose maximize bid, maximize clicks as you're bidding strategy, you end up spendinga lot more per click than you would have if you bid manually for each individual keyword or a differentsemi-autonomous or autonomous bidding strategy.And again, I'm not against autonomous bidding.Four or five years ago, autonomous bidding was really bad, didn't work.Over the last few years, certain autonomous bidding strategies have gotten a lot better.And in some cases we have accounts that are spending literally $1,000,000 a month on on Google ads.And we run a large portion of that budget through maximized conversions or maximize a certain returnon ad spend.And it works really, really well.And it could be even more efficient than manual bidding, but really basically never this default optionof maximize clicks.So if I were to use maximized clicks, I could enter in a maximum bid CPC bid limit which tells Googlewhatever you want to do.Don't ever get me more than don't ever charge me more than $2 for a click.Like don't put me in an auction where my click would have to cost more than $2.That's really what you're saying.But what we want to do is we want to go ahead and select a different bid strategy directly.So we're going to go ahead and click on this button.Well, if you drop down over here, you'll see that we might have we might have had the option.You might have the option depending on if this is a brand new campaign or if this is a campaign thathas historic data, you might be able to optimize for conversions or conversion value.In our instance, we can't because this is a new campaign and in order to optimize a bid around conversionsor conversion value, you need to have conversions logged in the account with an associated conversionvalue and we don't have that set up yet.This is a brand new account, new campaign, so we'd have to go with clicks, but we're going to goahead and click select a different strategy directly.Now, when I twirl down this menu, I have a whole bunch of different options.I have target CPA, target, return on ad spend, maximize clicks, maximize conversions, target asearch page location.Interesting, but it's cooler than it sounds.It's not so useful in because we're going to be able to run a script on top of keywords.If you remember from the was it the second video where we did a sneak peak on the bid to average positionscript target our ranking share in hand CPC or manual CPC?These are the different bidding strategies available to us.There is, again, there's no right or wrong.I can basically tell you that maximize clicks and target our ranking share are not good strategies.They don't really tend to work.They're really not popular targets.Page location again is one of those that really don't.I don't think it does.I haven't seen it to have too many relevant applications, but target CPA, target ROIs, maximize conversions.And really the most popular in my opinion that should be is manual CPC and enhanced CPC.It gives you the most control and if I had to pick one autonomous bidding strategy that would take thecake outside of manual CPC and enhanced CPC would be targeting a CPA.That's what we found to work the best.Not that in concept, it's any better than target as target areas is also pretty good.But in in practicality from seeing hundreds of accounts, target CPA is the is the autonomous biddingstrategy that has the most likelihood to work for you.But there's going to be a caveat about that and we'll talk about that in upcoming lectures.So I want to pause and go through some slides to give you a good sense and a better, deeper understandingof each one of these available building strategies.And we're going to pick that up very shortly in the very next lecture.I look forward I look forward to seeing you guys there very soon.
