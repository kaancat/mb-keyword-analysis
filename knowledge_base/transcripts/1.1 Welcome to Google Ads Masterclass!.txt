# 1.1 Welcome to Google Ads Masterclass!

How do you Google adds fans and welcome to my Google Ads Masterclass.Good morning.Good afternoon.Good evening.Good night.Whatever time it is for you, it's never a bad time to learn Google ads to figure out how to use theworld's most popular and largest advertising platform to increase the profitability of your business.My name is Isaac Rojansky, but before I introduce myself, I want to first take a moment to say thankyou.This course has literally changed my life, and it's changed the lives of so many of my students.This is actually the third iteration and volume of this course.It's the best selling Google ads course online anywhere in the world.As far as I can tell, over 100,000 students have enrolled in this course.And literally, not a day goes by where I don't get a LinkedIn message, a Twitter message, an email.And actually and I'm telling you, this is like totally the truth.The last two times I was in New York City, out for dinner to total strangers who were students of mine,came over to me and said, Hey, are you Isaac Radomski?I've taken your course.One person said it helped him land a new job.Another person said it's helped them grow their business tremendously just by following along step bystep.As I teach proven concepts and techniques in Google ads that will be effective that will help your campaignsbe more profitable.So this course has had an enormous impact on me.It's allowed me to grow my agency at venture media to more than four times the size as it was beforeI first launched this course and teaching and helping students be better at their jobs and get new jobsand launch a career in digital advertising, or be able to launch their own successful online business.It's just incredibly satisfying.It's incredibly fulfilling, and I have an enormous amount of appreciation that I'm able to providethat.And I have a lot of gratitude to you, my student, for taking this journey with me, for enrollingin this course today.I'm really, really excited.And I think that you're going to gain an enormous amount and I'm going to gain by being able to interactwith you throughout this course.So really sincerely.Thank you.Thank you very much.And I and I and I truly hope that this course provides everything that you expect it to provide, plusa whole lot more.One or two quick housekeeping things before I introduce myself and my background.I try to really incorporate as much feedback from students as I possibly can.And as you could probably imagine, with 100,000 students, I've got plenty of complaints.By and large, I've had really good reviews over 100,000 students and an average review of 4.74.8 starsfor this course.But I have gotten a couple critiques and one of them was that sometimes I talk too fast, so I'm goingto try to slow down.And another critique is that I tend to repeat myself too many times.That's a little bit of a tricky one because a lot of students have said that they enjoy that.A lot of students have said that.Sometimes I tend to repeat myself, so I'm really going to try to not repeat myself unnecessarily.Few students have mentioned that some of the lectures were too beginner than what they were expecting.So I want to let you know that if you're not totally new to Google ads and you know how to set up yourown campaign, you understand the basic set settings of a campaign structure.So then you could go through the curriculum and find the topics that you're more interested in.Maybe you want to learn how to calculate lifetime value.Maybe you want to learn how to set up E commerce conversion tracking.Maybe you want to learn how to run an advanced AdWords script.And by all means, feel free to jump around.I'm trying to keep this course.It's a long course, and I'm trying to keep the modules as organized and as easy to understand as possibleso you could really jump around and skip through and go to the lectures that are most relevant to you.And the last critique is that my slides, which I do make available, were they had a black backgroundand people and students wanted to print out the slides.And of course it wasted a lot of ink.So I listen, I did this last night at 2:00 in the morning.I redid all my slides to have a white background with dark text to make it easier for you guys to printout the slides.So I might have a lot of faults, but I don't.I really do try to incorporate your feedback as much as possible.And I'm open, of course, to more feedback.I'm I love criticism as long as it's honest criticism and it's something which is helpful and will makethis course a whole lot better.So let me introduce myself again.My name is Isaac Rozanski.As you know, I am the co-founder of Adventure Media.We're a Long Island based digital advertising agency.We're one of the fastest growing digital digital advertising agencies in New York.And I also want to take a moment to say thank you to the great team here at Adventure Media for allowingme to film this course, film this course in the office.And I know it's been a bit of an imposition on some people and they've been really, really good sportswith it.The first course I shot in my apartment, so it didn't bother anybody, but I wanted to have a littlebit more of a professional setting.We have a professional camera crew and a video crew and a makeup crew.I'm just kidding.There's no makeup, as you could tell.So this is a venture media.We're a digital advertising agency that helps clients like Forbes magazine, AMC Networks, the InternationalCulinary Center carries negotiating, and over 400 other brands increase the profitability of theirdigital advertising campaigns.We manage over $100 million in PPC spend.We help clients increase their website conversions by performing website audits, conversion optimization,a B testing, landing page design, Facebook, messenger, chat, bot marketing, Facebook advertisingall sorts of exciting digital advertising campaigns.We're doing a lot of exciting things.You can check us out online at Adventure BBC.com W WW Adventure.BBC.com As you know, I'm also an online instructor with over 100,000 students.Each of my courses are best selling courses in their categories.I teach about landing page design.I teach about Google ads formerly Google AdWords, and I'm probably going to make that mistake and callit AdWords because it's shifted from Google AdWords now to Google ads.So forgive me if I if I refer to it as it's old name AdWords.I teach Facebook Messenger Marketing and I have a lot more courses and a lot more content coming throughthe pipeline.I speak regularly at industry events and online marketing conferences around the country.I'm going to be speaking at Growth Marketing Conference in San Francisco coming up soon.I speak at Facebook Chat Bot Summits recently in collaboration with Larry Kim from Mobile Monkey andfrom Word Stream.And hopefully and I'll be speaking at a lot of events on an ongoing basis, I hope I can continue tobe invited to these events, and I hope that I can meet you at one of these events in person.That would be incredibly exciting.Also a contributing editor to some of our industry leading journals and blogs like search engine journals,the three Q Digital Blog, Frederic Vallee's optimize your blog, so on and so forth.So I'm sure you could catch up with some, some of the things that I've written for those blogs andfor, of course, our own blog at Adventure BBC.com.I have a master's degree in industrial organizational psychology IO Psych from Hofstra University inLong Island, and that degree really focuses a lot on psychological principles apply to the modern workplace.And that degree, while when I first started that program, I really had no idea that I was going togo into business and start a company and get into digital advertising.That's a whole different story unto itself.I won't bore you with that now, but the degree and the principles that I learned throughout that master'sprogram were incredibly helpful and invaluable with what I'm doing today.Not only has it helped me build the agency, but it's also helped me run successful and profitable advertisingcampaigns for our clients.And it's going to help you do the same.We're going to have a whole section on on on motivation, on how consumers make buying decisions, differencesin demographics and all that stuff is extremely important because while the bulk of this course reallydeals with the technical part of Google ads, how to use it, how to use all the features going frombeginner to advanced using every single opportunity you have.Ultimately what it comes down to is getting people to buy something from you, and that's incrediblyhard to do.It's not easy to get somebody who doesn't know you to buy from you, whether it's signing up for yourservices, it's buying your products, it's making a phone call or signing up for a newsletter, whatever,whatever that conversion action that you're tracking on your website is going to be.And of course, we're going to learn all about conversion tracking and attribution models and all thatexciting stuff you're ultimately trying to get somebody to buy from you.But more importantly, I'm going to touch upon this briefly in the next lecture.You need to get people to buy from you where you're generating more revenue than what you're spendingon your advertising.That is the only metric of success in an advertising campaign.It's not about how well, you know, Google ads.It's not about how big your campaigns are.It's not about how many keywords you have.It's are you selling and generating more revenue than you're spending.So and that's very tied to psychology.It's very tied to understanding behavioral psychology.And we're going to get to that.I originally decided to create this course a few years ago because in our agency Adventure Media, Isaw so many clients, so many businesses with better products, better services, better customer supportteams, a better website getting killed, getting demolished by their competition in the digital advertisingspace.They were wasting money on digital advertising campaigns.They didn't know how to attract the right types of people to their website, people who were expressingexpressing actual commercial intent to buy the products.And it was a shame.Like it was so easily fixed if people just had proper training and really be able to understand themediums, the platform.They'd be able to outperform their competition and win back a lot of that business from the competitionthat the competition was taking from them.And I realize, hey, if I could bring this training to the masses and I could help people do this,then we'll see a much more level playing field.That was one of the primary reasons why I originally created this course, and thankfully I think thatthat reason has come to fruition.Of course, another reason that I've created this course is it exposes our agency to more potentialclients.And we've thankfully have been able to sign an enormous amount of clients, large companies.You'd be surprised at some of the companies that have bought this course for their digital marketingteams PayPal, Tesla, Citibank, literally just to name a few.So this course was created with that goal in mind.And this course is not about making your products better necessarily, although we'll talk about makingyour website better, but this course is helping you understand the advertising platform so you couldat least compete at the same level that your competitors are competing.Google ads, like I said, is the most popular advertising platform in the world.I guarantee you that if you're interested and you're thinking about running Google ads or if you'realready running Google ads campaigns, your competitors are already doing it.So it's really worth your time to start thinking about these things and to go slowly and to really getas much information as possible to really understand this.It's natural that you're going to have lots of questions as you go through the course.Udemy has a question and answer discussion forum in every single individual lecture.If you click the Q&A button at the top of the screen, you'll see a list of all the different questionsand answers that students have had.I am sometimes active in the Q&A forum, but I am not always active in the Q&A forum.The best place to get support is in the Facebook group.It's a private members only Facebook group for students of this course.More information below about getting access to that Facebook group.That's where I'll be most active.That's where other students will be most active.That's where you could post pictures and videos of issues you might be having of your own campaigns.Talk about your Google ads journey.So the Facebook group is really the place to go to to get questions.But of course, you could scroll through the question and answer forum at each of these individual lectures,see if your question was answered.Very likely it has.I think almost every single lecture in this course has has some sort of question and answer discussionthread going on in it.So it's really worth your time to look through there.But if you do have another question, of course you could post it there.Maybe another student will reply, maybe I'll get a chance to reply.I have teachers assistants actually that might be able to reply, but the best chance of getting supportis in that Facebook group.So lastly, thank you again so much.I mean that sincerely.Honestly, it means a huge amount to me that you're putting your trust in me, that you're taking thisjourney with me.I'm incredibly excited to be taking this journey with you.I think this is a mutual relationship.I'm benefiting enormously from having you as a student.I hope you're benefitting enormously from having me as an instructor.And this is going to be a long journey.It's going to be an exciting journey.But when you come out on the other end, you're going to be within the top 1% of digital advertisersin the world running the most professional, effective Google ads campaigns for your business.And that's not something to take lightly.So thank you and I look forward to seeing you very soon in lecture two, where I'm going to give youa sneak peek of what's to come throughout the rest of this course.Cheers for now.
