# 10.3 Branded Search Philosophy

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about branded search philosophy and what we mean when we talk aboutbranded search.So what are branded terms.Simply put branded terms are just keywords and search queries that include your company's name in thesearch term.For example, if you're Nike branded terms might include Nike shoes, Nike running gear, Nike Air Max,and here's an example of a branded search on the right hand side.So if somebody searches for Adidas running shoes, they might see this ad for Adidas.So Adidas is choosing in this case to bid on their branded search terms.When somebody a customer is already searching for their brand, they are choosing to enter into thatauction and to potentially pay Google some amount of money to get that customer to their site, eventhough the customer was already searching for their brand.And there's a number of reasons why brands might want to do this.There's a number of reasons why brands might not want to do this.So the big question is, should I be bidding on my branded terms?For example, let's say Adventure Media, my agency.Somebody searches for adventure media reviews.Adventure media website.Adventure media services.They're clearly looking to get to our website.So do I want to bid and maybe pay $1, $3, $9, depending on the competition, to get people to oursite.Well, let me do a search and let me show you my screen for what would happen and what the user wouldsee when they would, um, when they would do that search.So I'm going to open up a new tab and we'll search for adventure media reviews.So this is my, um, This is stuff that this is information that only I see.But over here we have a couple ads that appear.So the Remnant agency, top rated TV ad agency Jump Fly says better than adventure.Um, slice bread agencies, boutique digital agency.Google ads premium partner.These are agencies that are bidding specifically on our terms.Now you can make the argument that somebody is looking for adventure media reviews.So they're going to search.They'll click on our website or they'll click on our organic result or whatever it may be.But do I want to potentially allow jump Fly or the Remnant Agency or Slice Bread Agency to appeal tothe user to appeal to that person with some headline that might be captivating and have them go, let'ssay, you know, go check out Jump fly site.Um, and potentially submit a proposal.Submit a request for proposal for from from a competitor when I might rather pay that dollar $2 andget that person and show an ad, or potentially show an ad at the top of the page.So here are some high level factors to take into consideration when you want to decide.When you're deciding whether or not you should be bidding on your brand ad terms.Number one is the competitive landscape.So assess competitor activity using the Auction Insights report.We went through the Auction Insights report.We're going to go through it when we go through our dashboard walkthrough.Um but that should give you a sense of whether or not it even makes sense to to enter into to auctionsif it's highly, highly competitive and competitors are bidding on each other's terms, that would bea reason to enter in to auctions for branded terms.Conduct regular Google searches to see how competitors are positioning themselves.Use incognito mode to get unbiased search results.So go into a private browser or clear your cookies.Run some searches for your brand name, some searches for competitor brand names and you'll get a layof the land.Cost benefit analysis.So very simply evaluate the additional cost of showing up for your branded terms and analyze search,impression, share and metrics like search lost due to budget and rank.So if you have search lost due to budget and rank, and that's a high percentage of the search searchesthat you're losing, then you might want to consider, um, entering into more aggressively into brandedsearch terms.You don't want to be losing, um, rank and impression share when a lot of other competitors are areshowing ads for your for your company's name, you might be asking, well, how do I evaluate the additionalcost of showing up for my branded terms?Well, you won't really know what the cost is going to be until you try.Usually branded terms are pennies on the dollar, usually your clicks for your own brand name.Google understands that this brand search is your website is your brand name.You own that term and you're going to have a very low actual CPC, but not always, but any in any event,you're going to be getting clicks and it's going to cost something.And the way we tend to think about this is you look at pot odds, and it's a concept in poker whereyou're you're already so deep in a hand that to see the next card you, there's a certain amount that's,that's just worth paying.And I look at that with, with branded search as well.You spend a lot of money and a lot of time getting to this point.Meaning what is this point that there's an individual searching for your brand name and all of the precedingwork that got you to that point or got the company to that point?Do you really not want to see the next card?Do you really not want to throw in the next, the next $0.50 or a dollar to just ensure or to increaseyour chances of receiving that click and not having that user directed routed to a competitor's website.You don't want to take that chance.In most cases.You don't want to take that chance.And and because you've already invested so much time and money building the business to the point wherepeople are actually searching for your brand name.In my view, unless the costs are exorbitant for brand brand name clicks, especially if competitorsare showing ads on your brand terms, then I would very much encourage you to consider running ads onyour brand terms.I think that money is typically almost always a good investment.Number three performance testing.You could implement incrementality testing to measure the true impact of bidding on branded terms.There are templates and frameworks for structured testing.We offered some.We offer some of these templates and frameworks in the Adventure Academy, but there are tests thatyou can run to see if bidding on your brand terms actually is making a difference in sales.It's a more sophisticated way of going about this.You could also use bid management strategies.One is limiting your CPC and experiment with various bidding strategies.So if I if I do want to invest on brand advertising, but I don't want to go crazy, I don't want tospend a large portion of my budget on branded terms, then I could create a manual search campaign andlimit the CPCs on branded terms.That way I won't be paying above a certain amount for, um, search queries that include my brand name.I could also, um, experiment with different bidding strategies.So maybe I want to use target CPA, but generally my target CPA for a top or middle of the funnel searchcampaign that is non-branded might be $100.My cap on CPA for clicks of a branded campaign might be $15 or $20.So those would be interesting strategic ways of using bid strategies to limit your exposure and yourcost for branded terms.You could also leverage audience exclusion lists, so avoid bidding on searches to post-purchase support,tracking, or career opportunities.Ensure you're your targeting is focused on potential customers to maximize ROI.So, for example, a lot of people are going to be looking for you know, we see this with SaaS allthe time, a login page a lot of people might be looking for just sort of how to get how to get an orderconfirmation.So you could use audience exclusions by telling Google, I want to bid on brand terms, but don't showmy ad to any previous customer.And that would be used by adding audience lists, uploading those lists into Google, and naming thatlist something clear so you could understand that you that you could recognize that this list are allpeople who have purchased from me, who I don't want to bid, who I don't want to be showing ads to.Um, and that way, you could be sure that your branded traffic campaigns are only showing sponsoredads at the top of the Google search results to people who are not yet your customers.Lastly, you can use search terms, negative search terms, and audience Exclusions to filter out lowvalue traffic.So if it's maybe somebody looking for adventure media, um, pirated courses, I'm sure that's a search.So I would want to make sure I'm not advertising on search like that so people can say things and useand by the way, the way they express themselves, whether, you know, some of the popular ones arelike Craigslist, Amazon, free, whatever it may be, there might be certain, uh, or how to likecertain searches that would indicate a person is really looking to do this themselves or do somethingdifferently, even if they're including your brand name.And you could use negative search, negative negative keywords.And again, audience exclusions to limit the exposure you have on branded.A lot of you are tempted.It's very tempting to go to Google and search for your brand name to make sure that your ads are showing,so it's best to avoid doing that as much as possible, because one, it's not an accurate representationof how frequently your ad is actually being shown.Classic example.If you you'd probably avoid clicking on your own search results because that's going to cost you money.If you do a search that pulls up one of your ads and you click, you're going to get charged the actualCPC bid.But if you do hundreds and hundreds or thousands of searches to pull up your own ads and you don't click,then Google's going to learn that you're not somebody who clicks on this company's result, and Googlewill eventually stop showing that ad to you.Ethan.So it's not necessarily an accurate reflection of the search engine results page for other people whoare doing searches.Um, it's also going to deflate your CTR, your click through rate.So if you rack up lots of impressions, because every time you do a search and add a shown, you getan impression, but you don't get a click that's going to go back into Google as an impression withouta click, and you're going to lose click through rate.Your click through rate will be artificially deflated.The percentage of impressions that lead to a click will be artificially deflated in your actual GoogleAds reporting.If you do this frequently as the search impression share metric, that's the most accurate way to determinehow often your ad is showing.How do how often your ad is showing.And of course, clicking on your own ads is going to cost you money.Um, you could also use the ad preview and diagnosis tool that is a tool inside the tools panel in GoogleAds AD Preview and Diagnosis, you could select a keyword, a campaign, and a location to diagnoseand to test if the ad that you're wanting to see is eligible to be shown, and if it is showing up onthe search engine results page for a new user in that targeted location.Now, how might you determine the percentage of spend you should allocate to branded campaigns?So as we've discussed, you want to analyze the Auction Insights report.So you head over to your Auction Insights report in Google Ads.And you look at an impressions share analysis search lost due to rank and search lost due to budget.So as you see in the screenshot over here, search lost due to rank 72.4%.So let's just call that 72%.That means you're losing 72% of available impressions because your ad rank is not high enough.That's a combination of your quality score and your and your actual bid and search lost due to budgetis only a half a percent.So that's that's telling you that you have enough budget allocated to the campaign to get more impressions.Share for your branded terms, but your ad rank needs to be improved.So if you're running a sale, you might want to adjust budgets to capture more traffic and input.Seasonality, bid adjustments, seasonality, bid adjustments is telling Google that we are expectinga bump in conversion rate.We're expecting a bump in search volume.Um, So if you're running, if you're currently running a promotion or you're experiencing a seasonalityor a seasonal bump in sales, um, then you might want to increase the budgets of your branded youryour branded campaigns.Or you want to make sure you're increasing your bids.If you're seeing so much, such a high percentage of of of search impression share lost due to yourad rank not being strong enough, that's likely a factor in your actual bid.If it's a new campaign, it's a new branded campaign.Just start small.You could start with a limited daily budget, whether it's $50 or $100 or $10.It all depends on the the larger budget in your account.And then continue to monitor this auction insights report, monitor how frequently you're showing upand you're actually getting placements for your branded terms.And that will give you a sense whether or not your competitors are generating clicks and impressionson your brand equity.Best practices for branded campaigns include audiences under observation mode to analyze the types ofaudiences coming to your site, YouTube viewers, returning users, purchasers, and so on.So remember we talked about the difference between observation mode and targeting mode when we're dealingwith audience cohorts.Observation mode is just a reporting organization insight tool that will allow us to look at clicks,impressions, click through rate conversion rate, all of the key KPIs segmented out by audience type.So maybe I want to analyze returning users.What percentage of visitors who came to my site are now searching for my brand name?Number two create separate ad groups for different types of branded searches.So oftentimes people will just lump all of their branded traffic into one ad group.But that's not a good idea.You might have your branded terms, and then anybody who's looking for a sale, or people who are lookingfor your brand name and specific products.People who are looking for your brand name and reviews.People who are looking for your brand name and coupon codes.People who are looking for your brand name and similar companies, or just facts and statistics, orabout your company history.And that will allow you to really direct those people to specific pages, crafting much more relevantcontent for those individuals.Now look, your brand names.Your brand campaigns are definitely going to typically have the best performance, the highest Roas,the lowest CPA, and the best conversion rates.But don't mention it.What does that mean?Don't mention it.It means it's not something to lord over to your clients.If you're managing campaigns for your clients or you're managing campaigns internally.Um, you don't want to call an enormous amount of attention to the Roas from a brand campaign.Your Roas from your brand campaign should be high.You should have the highest conversion rate, which would give you the most revenue, and you shouldhave the lowest cost, which is going to give you the best Roas.Next, use brand exclusions for other campaigns or implement keyword sculpting across other campaigns.If you want to get all.If you want to get a real accurate sense of how much money you're spending on brand traffic.Don't use these tactics to direct any queries that include your brand name into this branded campaign.That so the way to do that is using negative keywords with your brand name or using brand exclusionson other campaigns.That's going to make sure that the ads and ad groups and those campaigns do not trigger an ad for yourbrand name, and it will force Google to pull an ad and a keyword from your branded campaign.And then all of the money that you spend on on queries that include your brand name will show up inthe reporting for that branded campaign, and that will give you the highest fidelity, insight andanalysis how much money you're spending on brand terms, how much volume there is of people searchingfor your brand name and what results you're generating from clicks coming in from branded traffic.Keep in mind that you can capture branded traffic through shopping placements as well.So even though you're not, you might not be seeing all those search queries in shopping.Brand traffic can absolutely be caught in shopping campaigns.So now you have a good understanding of what we mean when we say branded campaigns and branded terms,branded campaigns or campaigns that are targeting and telling Google to bid on queries that includeyour brand name, your company name.And when we say branded, is it a branded term?Is it was it a search query?Was that what the person typed into Google Search?Was that query something that included your brand name?In the next lecture, we're going to talk about our top tips for structuring and building effectivesearch campaigns.
