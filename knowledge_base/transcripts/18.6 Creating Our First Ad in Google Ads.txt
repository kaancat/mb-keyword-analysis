# 18.6 Creating Our First Ad in Google Ads

How do you Google out fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we are going to write our first ad together.I don't have any ideas pre-planned.We're going to really write this together.I hope you guys are not getting bored of me.We've been together for quite some time now and we have a lot more to go, so let's pace ourselves anyway.Here we are back in the Google Ads interface.So the final URL is going to be the remember the URL that we want people to actually go to, not thedisplay URL.So I'm going to go back to Poppin.And because this ad group, if you remember, is not a specific group, it's the general office chairad group.I'm just going to take the top line office chair page.So I don't want them to go to the active seating page.Just click up here.I want them to go to this page where they can then self select the type of office chair that they want.So I'm going to copy this URL, bring it in here, select all paste and I'm getting a warning.Oh, right.It has to be https.So we're going to do an https over there and we're going to go and write some headlines.So I want to incorporate all the different things we've spoken about, but of course I can't put everythinginto one ad.So my headline one.Let's think about price.I think that this is an industry and of course that I haven't done real research and we would do realresearch.And you have to do your research and you have to know your products.But I think office chairs have a huge range of price.And if somebody is just searching for a generic office chair, they might be looking for an office chair.That's $70.They might be looking to spend 5000 on an office chair.Right.So I want to first.Convey the price range we're in.And I also want to convey legitimacy.So I'm going to try to use that registered trademark.I'm going to be popping.Option R Office Chair's title case from 299.No, we're 33 characters out of 30.And let's see, I could take two out by taking out these spaces.Ooh, I could.I could take out my registered symbol.I think I'm going to have to do that.I think I'll have to take out because I don't see what else I can cut popping office chairs from 299.All right.So we'll have to go like this, 30 out of 30 pop in office chairs from 299.And also one more good piece of advice.And I hate it when I see people do this.Don't leave out.Space that Google's giving you?Yeah, if you get 20 characters 25, that's fine, of course.But don't have a headline with ten characters, don't have a description with 30 characters.I It irks me so much when I see people just giving up free real estate that Google's offering.Popping off shares from 209.So that's going to help me first just tell people what price range we're in.We're starting at 299.So if you're looking for a $50 task chair or a folding chair or whatever it is, that's not us.Minimum $300 headline two.What makes Poppin unique?What makes them stand out?And I think it's they're they're very vibrant with their colors.They're very color coordinated as a company.And if you do take a minute to take it, take out your site, you'll see that that's a big theme.They match their desk accessories to their chairs, to their desks.It's a really sort of cool, cohesive, artistic office chair company.So maybe we could talk about that.I think that's something which is unique that most other office products companies don't probably,probably don't talk about.So I'm just going to talk out loud here.Vibrant colors.Uh, vibrant colors that match your personality.Wow.I'm way over 42 characters.Vibrant colors.It's about unique, vibrant colors.Available or one character over.But in stock.Exactly 38 of 30 unique, vibrant colors in stock.All right.So if somebody is potentially and I think this does a couple of things, it conveys the type of companywe are in.It will probably give a good.Prediction in the USA's mind of what types of terrors they're going to see.If you're looking for more of that very corporate look, we would probably not be talking about vibrantcolors.If you're looking for a more fun, modern workspace, then this is the type of headline you want tosee.So I think we're doing a good job already at conveying a really strong focus and a really strong imageof our brand.Right.We have a certain price point.Poppin is the name and unique vibrant colors in stock, the only type of company selling office sharesthat would talk about unique and vibrant colors.Is that sort of fun, modern, techie vibe for an office open office space or something like that?You have the option now in Google ads to add a headline.Three Of course, only two headlines will show up, or you could write a headline three.And Google was substituted at different times to test which combinations of headlines work the best.So we could write a different version of our headline too.Or we could write a completely different headline altogether.So let me jump over back into the website and see if I could figure out anything that I would want toput off the bat that sort of makes them stand out.I see that they have a wide range of styles on their site, and I think a lot of other companies willsell a very specific style.They have these rolling chairs, they have fabric chairs, they have all different sorts of seating.And we're talking again about generic searches.So we want to sort of try to cover all our bases.If this was the ad group that spoke about rolling chairs, then we would specifically talk about thefeatures of our rolling chairs.So maybe we'll say.Every.Choose from a full line.Of Styles.Oh, I'm not going to.Uh.How about you?Our.View our full range of styles that works.Remember, I would do more research if.Does this company have specific accolades?Have they won any awards?Are they known for the durability of their chairs or how long their chairs last or things like that?Or are they known for a really unique warranty?That's something that I would put in.I would say like say free shipping, 30 days guaranteed.If that was the case, that would be a great potential headline number three or headline number two.And of course, like I said, I'm not sure if I mentioned this.It's very important to always have at least at least two ads minimum in an ad group, but I would usuallyrecommend for ads.That way you could test for different versions of a headline through a B testing, but at the very,very, very minimum have at least two different ads in every single ad group.And putting in a third headline does not mean that you've put in a second full ad, so you have a coupleof display paths that we'll want to clean up.So maybe we'll do something like office chairs.All chairs.Something like that.Or because this is a general, maybe we'll just say you're going to go to pop incom office chairs becausethat's this is the general aid group.We could leave Path to Empty.Now we have 90 characters for two descriptions.Let's say they have over.3500 businesses have been using our high quality office chairs.For over 20 years, and I don't have any more time for a call to action, though.Right.So, again, we want to think about that behavioral model.I think that a person is sufficiently motivated to buy an office chair.They probably need it.But that perceived ability, like, can I afford it?Is this the type of thing that I want?Will it work for me?Is it going to is it going to be comfortable, etc.?Those are all things that would fall under that perceived ability.Canopy Perceived ability camp part of the equation.So by giving legitimacy, by telling us of the high quality, by, by talking about our length and business,helps make a person feel that they're more likely to be satisfied with our purchase.So but there's no specific call to action.But again that's not necessarily you don't necessarily have to right click me right.I think that when you talk about these three concepts, quality years in business and the amount ofclients we have that have bought from us, that's a very, very powerful ad.And again, you want to be measurable, objective and verifiable.So 3500 businesses, that's objective.High quality is measurable.It's verifiable.When you come to the website, we can talk about the quality.Hopefully the landing page talks about the quality of the chairs.20 years in business, it's objective, it's specific.It's not these are we're not using unsubstantiated superlatives.If I had more space, I would talk more about the specifics of the quality, because just saying highquality is a little bit unsubstantiated, but it's okay to have the website substantiate that.If the website is substantiating that description too, maybe it'll be a slightly different variationin the same on the same theme.Something like Join.Join 35,000 plus customers.Um.Who?Can't.Whose behinds are.In love.With our.Advanced.Cushioning tech.All right.So another this this this description brings in a couple different elements.So a little bit of attitude, a little bit of humor, like our customers, who's behind?They're in love because these are chairs, so their butts are in love with our advanced cushioning technology.We talk about a little bit something specific about the quality advanced cushioning technology.Again, you have that legitimacy, 35,000 plus customers.And that's a pretty good description.I think that that plays nicely with these headlines.And again, the headlines are the most important factor.So I think that qualifying by price and talking about the unique vibrant colors which gives off thatbrand personality is really important for a headline.But if I were to test this ad, I would put something about our customers.And then the second headline and I would run those two ads against each other because I've I've writtenthousands and thousands of ads and I've analyzed hundreds and hundreds of accounts.But I'm I know enough to know that I can't predict which one will work better.I don't know if a headline that talks about our unique and vibrant colors and a price qualifier willwork better than a headline with, let's say, a price qualifier, and then talking about how we have35,000 plus customers and we have advanced cushioning technology.I would test those and that would be a great test.Test those different headlines.You could open up your options to put in your traffic tracking templates at the ad level.If you're going to use tracking templates, you'll almost always use them at the campaign level.So we don't need to do that now.And plus, we already spoke about what those are.And of course, you could see some previews, a desktop preview of what this ad will look like.It's not showing us any previews of ad extensions.And we could see a preview of what our ad will look like on a mobile device with a nice little displayover here that looks really clean.And if you click on this little button here, Google will actually show us some example ads.And I don't think you need to look through those because our ads are always going to be a lot better.And once you come down, you click done.You have the option to now create another ad.I could duplicate this ad if I want to, and work from there.I could.I could trash this ad if I'd like to, and work from there.I could click new ad and just write another ad.I'm not going to do that now because it's just going to be repetitive, going through the same thing.We're going to be building out this campaign in a lot more detail and a lot more size and scope.As we move along, I'll click done.It actually saved a second ad.I'm going to delete one because it's the same thing.I have one ad and I'm going to go ahead and click Save and Continue and go on to billing.So now you really have a lot of good information about effective ad writing.You understand some psychological principles, you understand the behavioral model, you understandthe anatomy of expanded text ads, you understand character limits, you understand compliance issues,and you understand a lot of best practices.I think you're now in a really good position to write ads as good as anybody else.Just takes some time.It takes some effort, it takes some research, it takes some creativity, it takes some good thought.It takes an understanding of the business and the products.But I'm absolutely confident in you that you could do it.And I'm not just saying that to make you feel good, and I'm not just saying that it's like a rah,rah, rah.I've really seen people in our office that came in totally unable to write a decent ad, and they wenton to learn, to train, to practice, to test, to research.And they came out incredibly, incredibly effective ad copywriters.And I have no doubt that you could do the same with just a little bit of hard work.So we're going to click Save and Continue and move on to billing.And in the next section, I'm going to walk you through setting up your Google ad billing pretty straightforward.There's a couple different billing options.We want to get that out of the way to be a quick section and we'll then get into keywords the heartbeatof your Google ads account.And we maybe scratch the surface a drop about keywords, but we really haven't even begin begun to touchit.So I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
