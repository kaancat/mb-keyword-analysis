# 2.2 Understanding the Google Ads Auction

Let's talk about the fundamentals of the Google Ads auction.First, it's worthy to note that Google Ads works on an auction system.You don't have.It's not Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their tower, choosing what individual search terms and keywordscost.It is the advertisers.It is the competition.Just like an eBay auction that determines how competitive and how the pricing falls for any given keyword.If there's a billion searches a day on Google, and those billion searches each have ads, whether it'sshopping ads, it's max inventory, it's search ads, then there's a billion auctions happening.And that auction happens in real time at the time of the search between you, between the user hittingenter and the search results, loading on the page and the matter of 100 milliseconds.So Google Ads uses a CPC based model to determine which ads to show.Cost per click.The advertiser only pays Google when their ads are clicked.You could get a million impressions for your ads.A billion impressions for your ads.But if your ad does not receive a click, you do not pay Google anything.
