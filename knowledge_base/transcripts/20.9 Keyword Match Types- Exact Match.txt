# 20.9 Keyword Match Types- Exact Match

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to be talking about exact match map type, which is the final form ofpositive match type that we're going to be discussing in more detail.Exact match uses brackets.Regular brackets enclose around your keyword to ensure your ad will only show four queries containingyour exact keyword without any additional words or phrases appended or dependent.Negative keywords are not needed to supplement exact match.And that sort of makes sense because the only search terms that are trigger my keywords are my exactkeyword or we'll see in a minute.Not my exact hardware necessarily, but we're not going to have additional words, phrases appendedor preprinted to it like we could have in every one of the other match types.Broad bar match modified and phrase exact match generates the highest clip, the rates and also themost expensive CPCs.And like we mentioned, high rates is great.I have a higher quality score typically, but not always, but typically and higher CPCs because myexact match keywords are typically my best keywords.They're typically the keywords that most of the competitors are that really want to get on top of.So like by leather office chairs online, anyone who's selling officers online, it wants that keyword,so they'll bid more aggressively on that exact version of it.Let's take a look at a couple of potential examples and what ads will show and will not show for leatherdesk chairs in brackets.We'll show faux leather desk chairs by by leather desk chairs.Even though that entire phrase is included.There's an extra word that's not in my keyword in the search term, and it will not show office accessoriesin brackets will show for office accessories will not show for office accessories for sale online again,even though the phrase is there in the right order for sale online are additional words that in thequery that do not appear in my keyword, therefore will not trigger that exact match keyword.Another example extra padded chairs.Extra padded chair without the SE can show plurals and slight misspellings as we'll talk about in asecond can show high quality extra padded chair is a search term that will not show even though it probablyis a good search firm for me to bid on, which is one of the downsides of exact match.Exact match.You're going to get the most specific traffic to your site.You're going to have the most control, but you'll really not be able to get any new ideas if your budgetis super, super constricted.And you're in the position, whether it be just from your own circumstance or the money you have available,that every dollar has to be spent as best as possible.As best as possible right away.There's no there's very little margin for error.Then exact match is your best friend.If there is margin for error and there should be margin for error, and we'll talk about how importantmargin margin for error is.When we talk about the Lynn Rudnitsky ratio, when we talk about auditing accounts that have data,there needs to be a certain level of error in the account because that shows that you're trying to findnew ideas.And finding new ideas for both negative keywords and positive keywords is how you're going to ultimatelyoutperform the competition.And I've said this a number of times, like broad match, our match, modified phrase match.They all allow you to find new ideas for both negative keywords and positive keywords using the searchterms report using actual data and actual data.What's actually happening in your account?How people are actually searching for your products and services?What's triggering what's triggering your keywords is the most valuable data.We spoke about keyword research a couple lectures ago.Right?We're going to try to find things by asking people using the Google keyword planner.There's no better place to actually get information about how your campaign is performing is from thesearch terms report.And the search firm's report is really valuable when it shows you additional search terms that are outsideof the specific constraints of your keyword and you won't get that with exact match.And again, that's not a reason to not use exact match.Exact match is great.Exact matches where you want to bid super aggressive on your super high level, top performing, highconverting keywords, the low hanging fruit go for exact match bid as high as possible until you'renot becoming profitable anymore.So we just squeeze as much return on ad spend out of your exact match keywords use them definitely don'thave an account without exact match.They're extremely important, but do whatever you can to have to have a have a campaign that's moredynamic.Have a campaign that doesn't only rely on exact match because the beautiful revelations of Google adswill come when you.When you.When you discover all the ideas that you could capitalize on profitably, that you'll that will be presentedto you through bras, bras, match, modified and phrase match, keyword match type.So that's what I encourage you to do.A couple of things to know about exact match.Google has made a bunch of changes to exact match over the years, and here's what we're holding now.Misspellings.So if a if chair is spelled C, H, R, e in the search term, it could still trigger your search forc, h, i, r, let's say singular or plural form.So if my exact match keyword is leather desk chair and somebody searches for a leather desk chairs,plural.Or vice versa.Google remains or Google retains the right to show an ad and trigger that exact match keyword stemmingso a pollster and a pollster ring.So if someone is looking for a post, if my keyword is a pollster shop near me and somebody searchesfor a pollster ring shop near me.Google retains the right, even if my keyword is exact match to trigger an ad through that exact matchkeyword abbreviation.So if my keyword says New York City or New York.And somebody searches for NY or NYC.Google retains the right to show my ad, even though it's an exact match keyword.That said New York inside the brackets.This is an interesting one.Reordered words with the same meaning.So Google is extremely vague on how they treat this because this sounds really like a match modified.Again, of course, the real big difference is it has to only be these words.It can't be any additional words and it can't be any words missing.But if it has the same exact meaning according to Google, they might trigger your ad.So if my keyword says men's shoes and somebody searches for shoes, men's and Google cannot differentiatea meaning or some sort of intent between the two.Then Google retains the right to trigger that exact match keyword.Google does say they won't reorder phrases like JFK to LG, to LG, to JFK, because that obviouslyhas a specific specifically in clear different meaning.Another big one addition or removal of function words such as in to for but a the so if my exact matchkeyword is chair's for office.Google retains the right to remove the function word and ignore it from exact match keyword.So if somebody searches for office chairs or chairs office, then Google retains the right to triggerthat exact match keyword because they're removing that function word of four implied words.So Google gives this example on their site.Daydream VR Headset.VR stands for Virtual Virtual Reality.So Google, if Google knows that Daydream is a virtual reality headset company and that's how they pegyour search term.Then if a person searches for a daydream headset, they might consider the word VR to be implied.And it means the same thing as your keyword.They still won't show daydream headset for sale because for sale is not part of your keyword and youdidn't necessarily imply that.But if it's specifically inherent to that product, then Google retains the right to trigger your exactmatch keyword.Synonyms is a new one that Google is now showing exact match keywords for.If your exact match keyword is bathing suits, Google might show or might trigger that exact match keyword.If somebody searches for swimming suits because swimming and bathing according to Google are synonyms,does Google have a list of synonyms?No, unfortunately they don't.But you'll get a sense of what these synonyms are by monitoring the search terms report same searchintent.So this is something which is really vague and really frustrating and really it's honestly really irksometo me because it's just like Google trying to make more money and like.Come on.Like you're offering us exact match, right?Just let it be exact match, like.Stop squeezing every ounce of control out of us.Like in your ruthless quest to maximize your ad dollars.It's just taking so much autonomy away from the advertiser.And it's just unfair that we have to play by these rules.And it bothers me, but this is what they say.So we have to play by the rules.Same search intent.If somebody searches for this and again, this is this is an example that Google themselves gives.If you're exact match keyword in your account is images royalty free and somebody searches for freecopyrighted images a totally separate word, but Google views it as the exact same intent.Then Google reserves the right to trigger an exact match keyword for image's royalty fee free to showthat ad.Luckily for any of you that are interested, I'm going to show you a script written by by Daniel Gilbertand his team over at Brain Labs to make exact match exact again and that's going to be by the scriptis going to be mining your search terms report constantly and every day every hour adding more negativekeywords until you're sort of left with your gist of your exact match versions of your keyword.So there is a script available to make exact match.Exactly, which is awesome.It's really neat.It's fun to use.It's really worthwhile checking out if you want to do that.But with everything that I just mentioned, with Google taking away all this control, with Google not.You know, with Google making the exact match, exact match, maybe, you know, this annoying littlein-between thing.Exact match still is pretty exact because you have to remember that Google has all these little ruleslike stemming and abbreviations and reordered words and same intent.But Google will not show your ads with additional words except for this same search intent.Like that's really about swapping out a specific word for a synonym.Google won't show your ads with additional words or with less words appended or dependent to your searchterm, except when you have like that VR example, which is rare.I haven't seen that much.It's still quite exact.You're still getting the benefits of exact.You're still going to be paying a lot more, your rates will be higher.You'll be getting the most amount of relevant traffic to your to your website by far when you're usingexact match, match type.That's exact match again.Make sure your your campaigns and ad groups have a mixture of all of them that you might have broken.You might have broken out your ad groups or even your campaigns by match type.And that's fine.That's a strategy that we've done a lot.We'll have a campaign for office chairs, exact office chairs, broad office chairs, phrase or ad groups,broad phrase, exact that's.And we've spoken about that as a potential idea for structuring your hierarchy, but it's totally fine.And in fact, in the last couple of years, almost all the accounts that I work on that I build andwe do here at the agency, all the matched types are mixed in into into each ad group.It's much better to just thematically structure your ad groups with themes then by match type, becauseyou could control the different bits.The exceptions would potentially be if you're bidding based on a CPA in a CPA basis, you might wantto segment out and match types by at the aggregate level so you can control your CPA bids and you canbid a higher CPA for exact match.But not not that an exact match is worth more, the conversions worth more.But you could get more volume for certain types of keywords if they're separated out by match type.So how you structure your ad groups with regards to match type might be influenced by the bidding strategiesbeing used, but in most cases you could have all these different match types together inside one adgroup, especially if you're bidding manual CPC or enhanced CPC, you have nothing to worry about.So that's an example.Those that's an overview of all the positive math types.In the next lecture, we're going to jump into negative match type and open up a whole can of wormsthere.And I look forward to seeing you guys very soon.And a couple of seconds.
