# 20.19 Keyword Research- Using the Google Keyword Planner 1

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.I have a bit of a cold.Bear with me.We'll get through this together.In the last lecture, we spoke about a few different ways of doing keyword research, like using theGoogle auto suggest and Google related searches, asking your friends and family looking at your websitenavigational structure.In this lecture, we're going to jump into the Google keyword planner, which is a really thorough androbust tool.It's extraordinarily useful.It's sort of like its own little software unto itself.And I want to show you some of the essential features, how to use it, both in the keyword researchphase for getting keyword ideas and also in the keyword planning phase which will allow you to get costestimates, volume estimates, and that sort of can be used in conjunction with some rush, etc..So without further ado, let's jump back into the Google Ads dashboard here in front of us.As you can see, the account has accrued some data.Obviously, this is money spent in the name of this this course just so we could see how the data actuallylooks like once it's once it's sort of coming in.So we have a few different ad groups that I built out.And you've seen some of these activities before.We don't really have ads.They're not running yet.And all the aggregates, rolling desk chairs, general office chairs, ergonomic chairs, just to giveyou a sense of how we want to structure out this campaign.But now I want to get some new keyword ideas.I want to see additional keyword ideas for different ad groups that I've already thought of, let'ssay like ergonomic chairs, general office chairs, rolling desk chairs.But perhaps I'll find some new ad group ideas as well that I might not have thought of up until now.There are two ways we could get into the Google Keyword Planner.We use the shortcut GTI and start typing in planner and we see keyword planner pop up over here.Or if we get out of there, we can go into tools under planning keyword planner, right?So I'm going to click on Keyword Planner and we have two options presented to us.Find new keywords, which is over here on the left.This is typically the tool you'll use most for your keyword research stage.And on the right we have get search volume and forecasts.I sort of categorize that tool as keyword more more keyword planning when we're sort of figuring outhow we want to put keywords into different ad groups, different thematically related groups of keywords.But at this point, we're just brainstorming.We're still brainstorming new ideas.So I'm going to click on Find New Keywords, and we have a couple of different options here.We can enter in a URL, write our any URL on our on our website or the URL of a competitor.Right?So keep that in mind.That's a cool thing.I'm gonna show you how to do that in a minute.Or keywords, phrases, or a combination of both.So I want to get ideas for my overall Office Chairs campaign, so I'm going to start off by taking theoffice chairs URL from Poppin, and I'm going to go over to Pop and grab the office chair's top levelURL, copy it, paste it into my Google Keyword Planner over here, click enter and I'm going to clickGet Started and we're going to see what Google presents me.So right off the bat, there's a bunch of different data, different tools.It almost, like I said, it looks like its own dashboard over here.And I want to walk you through some of the essential things that you could do over here on this screen.First, we could change the locations.Now, remember, Google is giving us ideas based on their own data.So over here we have search volume trends in this area.Down here, we have average monthly searches, searches, level of competition, top of page bid andall that.These estimates are based on certain criteria, so locations or locations.So since we only sort of operate in the United States and you would do this differently for your business,I'm going to go into the locations and just modify it to target the United States and click Save, similarto what we do when we set up our campaign settings and Google's new refresh, their estimates are goingto keep language as English, but if you are running campaigns in a different language, you could changethat.And search networks, if we click edit over here, we could change it from just Google or Google andthe search partners.And I when I'm getting keyword ideas, I typically leave it as Google because again, I'm just tryingto get ideas.I'm not necessarily looking to try to get cost estimates.This graph shows search volume trends, total and mobile.The blue bar over here represents in November 2017, total searches, and the red represents mobilesearches.So we're seeing mobile is getting a lot of the market share.Let's say in August 2018, well over half of searches were mobile searches for the keywords that they'representing over here, for the for the keywords that Google is suggested.For the keywords that Google is suggesting.Coming down into this area.We have a few very important things.The keyword sorted by relevance.These are keywords that Google is suggesting to us based on the URL that we provided.Average monthly searches.Average monthly searches and average monthly searches is notoriously inaccurate.I could show you our website, some of the keywords that Google suggests for our website.And I know just from research and from client research that these are really inaccurate.Average monthly searches, Google redirects a lot of their volume, but it's they could be used in contextof each other.What do I mean by that?Well, over here we see a keyword called pop in spiral notebook with with an average monthly searchvolume of 40, again for the United States in English, etc..And then it shows pop pop in file cabinet with an average monthly search volume of 1000.Now, 40 and 1000 might not be the accurate numbers.There might be 10,000 searches for pop and file cabinets.There might be 300 searches for pop and spiral notebook.But what we could be sure of is that there's a greater a significantly greater search volume for filecabinets than there is for spiral notebooks.All right.That's a big thing to keep in mind.Google then also gives you competition.Google then also gives you.Google then also gives you an output for competition.This is Google's own way of saying how many other competitors are bidding on this term and how aggressiveare they bidding?So as we see here, most of these are rated as high.Now, I would basically ignore this column.I really don't think it's important to even focus on because competition shouldn't.Now I would basically ignore the competition column because how competitive a search term is shouldn'tdeter you or motivate you necessarily to bid on that search term.It's good to get a sense of like OC is like, is this a really competitive search term?But by and large, whether it's high competition or low competition, search terms can still be goodsearch terms.And what I've also seen many times in the past is that, you know, keywords that have a low rating,a rating for low competitiveness isn't really that low of a competitive keyword.There are a lot of competitors and it's expensive.And sometimes keywords that are rated as a as high in competition are really easy to bid on and theyend up being cheaper than other keywords.So it's sort of.So it's so it's sort of all over the place for each individual keyword, let's say pop and ping pongtable.If I were to hover over the monthly searches graph, I would see a more detailed view of the last yearof search volume in the United States.So we could see it going up and down.And you might get some interesting trends.You might say, Oh, during a certain month there was a spike in searches for this keyword.During a certain month, there was a drop in keywords for the searches.Why did that happen?Investigate further.Ad impressions.Share this column over here.Ad Impressions.Share refers to the percentage of impressions you've received for a keyword.Divided by the total eligible amount of impressions that you could have received for that keyword,that something which is impression share in general.And we're going to have separate lectures that talk about impression share in more detail.But for now, the reason why these are blank is because this is a new account and we actually haven'tgotten any search volume for these keywords.If we change the criteria above for Google to give us suggestions based on some keywords that we actuallyhave in our account, then the ad impressions share column might start populating.Top of bid, low range and top of bid high range.Google is basically estimating what they think it will cost to get an ad at the top of the page.So for if I'm advertising on pop and ping pong table a branded search, Google is expecting that I wouldneed to bid between a dollar 84 in the low end and $2.98 on the high end.In order to hit the top of the page.In order for my ad rank to be high enough, we'll talk about ad rank and what that means in a minute.In order for my ad rank to be high enough to rate at the top of the page now as we go down.Account status shows whether or not a keyword is in our keyword plan.And we'll talk about how we could actually create keyword plans and add group plans using Google and.Account status refers to whether or not a keyword or negative keyword is in our current keyword plan.We're not actually creating a keyword plan right now.Right now we're just using this tool to get ideas.Once we talk about keyword planning, that's when we'll be using the keyword Google keyword plannerto actually create shells of ad groups and even campaigns that we like.And we're able to bring those back into our actual live account, which is a pretty neat thing.And we'll see that in a future lecture up here in the top right hand corner.You could change the date range.So if I want to just take a look at the last 24 months or the last month, I could do a custom daterange, all available data for a specific keyword, then you could change the date range around.I typically like to start off with all available data.I found that it gives you the most accurate sense of a keyword when it comes to monthly search volume.You get a sense of a little bit of a broader range of time how things have changed for a given keyword.So it's pretty neat if we click on search volume trends up here.I could do a couple of different things.I can look at search volume trends.So how many searches over the course of every given month, mobile and total?But I could also break down by platform and location.So if I were to break down by platform, let's see what that looks like.So it's showing me that there's 1.8 million average monthly searches for all the keywords, all the2491 keywords that Google is suggesting, and that 47% take place on a desktop.43% take place on mobile and 8% take place on tablet.I could also break down by locations, which is pretty neat.It will show me a breakdown of the next level of geographical region below what I've targeted in mylocation targeting settings up here.So over here I list the United States, so it's going to break it down by state.So if we see over here and show me a lot of searches in other states.13% California, 8% Texas, and 7% New York.6% Florida, 4%, 4.4% Illinois.And this is this could be helpful if you're a local business or if you don't ship or you don't sellin certain locations, if or if you just want to get a sense of do keyword, are more keywords, aresearches happening more in certain locations over other locations?If I were to change my location targeting to just one state, let's say I wanted to remove the UnitedStates and target New York.And click Save.My breakdown is now going to change.Now we're going to see different regions within New York.So we see Rochester, Syracuse, Binghamton, Utica, Watertown and other Neilson DM regions.So you're not going to get a huge amount of data, but depending on your search terms or depending onthe keywords that you're looking at, you might get some very interesting trends.I typically leave it at search volume trends because when I'm getting my keyword research ideas or gettingdifferent ideas for keywords, I like to see how volume is volume erratic or and then it's somethingthat I would investigate.And if I'm doing this for a client, I would start researching the industry, looking at news articles,what might have happened during the times where either search volume for certain keywords one way upor way down, and is there a healthy amount of volume over time?Now let's take a look at some of these keywords.I'm going to switch this back to 12 months just to make the graph look a little bit more manageable.And now let's analyze some of these keywords here.So as we scroll through, we see that a lot of these are related to pop into the pop and brand, whichis great because we're going to want to eventually create a pop in branded campaign for anybody specificallysearching for our brand name.And there are reasons why we would want to have such a campaign.You might be thinking, well, you're going to have that organic search result anyway.It's true, but there's really, really good reason to have a branded campaign in AdWords.So in Google ads.So we're scrolling down, we see I see a lot of things for pop in here.I see a conference table.I see a lot of things that are not related to chairs.And I might be getting some good ideas like, ooh, pink office accessories.That's cool.Mint filing cabinet.That's cool.But I'm looking for ideas for my chairs campaign.All right.So I want to see, is Google giving me some new ideas for that so I can go ahead and create a filterto filter the search terms or the keyword suggestions, rather, that are more relevant to what I'msetting out to do in this keyword research phase.So if I scroll up to the top, I could go into my filters and click add filter.So I'm already excluding adult ideas.That's by default.So broadly related ideas, that's by default.But I could do keyword text contains share.So I'm filtering out all these 20,500 search terms to just remain or to just leave all the keywordsthat include the word chair.But I also don't want branded, so I'm also going to remove keyword.Text does not contain.Poppin.So now I'm going to have a list of keywords that do not contain the brand name, but that also containthe word share.And that will at least set the stage to see if I can get some interesting ideas here.So I'm going to go ahead and click Apply.And now I'm left with keywords that are relevant to the campaign that I'm building inside Google ads.So I'll scroll down here.I'll take a look.Privacy.Privacy Lounge chair.Office chair.Well, office chair is an easy one.That's something that I've certainly already thought of.Computer desk chair.I didn't actually didn't think of computer desk.Gee, I thought of desk chair.I thought of executive chair, but I didn't think of computer desk chair, which is really interesting.It shows that there's a healthy amount of of monthly searches, highly competitive, which means thatother brands are bidding on it and it doesn't seem to be all that expensive.So that's certainly a keyword that I'm going to want to add to my campaign.There's a couple of things I could do.One is that could just put add that into my campaign right now.I could write it down on a notepad.I could save it in a separate word file.I could put it into Excel.I could also highlight it here and add it to a plan.Plans are the term used to define shells of ad groups and campaigns that you're going to use the keywordplanner to actually build and you'll be able to import those plans back into Google ads and make themactive live campaign.So it's a really great way.It's an efficient way to use this tool.So I can add it to a new ad group.I could change my broad match.I have a couple different options.I could add it as a negative keyword instead, but we want to add it as a positive keyword so we couldclick add it to a new ad group.I can name the ad group.Let's take all this computer.Chairs and I'm going to leave it as broad match for now create.And I'm going to go ahead and click Add to Plan.And as you can see over here, it shows in plan in green.So I just add to my plan and up here in gray, this keyword office chair is in my account already.So now it tells me that I don't need to go ahead and add office chair because it's already in my account.So that's a really, really helpful tool, that account status column.Now see, there's 500 keywords here.There's 405 keywords here.In another example, there might be thousands of keywords.I want to sort by things that are most relevant.I want to I want to sort of use my time most efficiently.That's a recurring theme when it comes to optimizing a Google Ads account or building a new Google Adsaccount from scratch.I tell this to my students all the time, there's and I tell this to my employees all the time, there'sno end to the amount of good work you could do in an account.There's just no end to it.You can stay in an account all day.You could look at more.You could look at you could research more data.You could look for more behavioral trends.You could find new negative keyword ideas.You could change bit, you could test you could always test new things.But there's a limited amount of time and resources that you're going to have to put into your accountat every stage, whether it be keyword research, planning, organization, optimizing, working onquality, score, whatever it may be, talking to a client, reporting all these things.So you want to try to find ways to not necessarily do the most perfect job in the world, but the bestjob that you have with the time allotted to you.And one of those things is to not necessarily have to go through 500 individual keyword suggestions,but maybe go through a top portion of the ones that will have the greatest impact in your account.And to do that, we could simply sort all this information by average monthly searches.So if I were to go up here and click average monthly searches at the top, it'll now sort the list inorder of the highest volume keywords.And typically the highest volume keywords are the ones that we really want to be on, because thoseare the ones that if we can get them to be profitable for us, they'll stretch our advertising dollarsthe furthest, they'll bring in the most traffic to our website, and they will drive the most conversions,which is exactly what we're trying to do.And of course, we have to make it profitable.So we see the top two most most popular ones already in our account.But here's the third one, Computershare.That seems to be a pretty good keyword.We want to select that white desk chair is another one.That's another good one.White office chairs another good one.Back support for office chair.Now this is an interesting keyword because this might be somebody who's really searching for a add onproduct to put on their office chair.Right.And that sort of sounds that's sort of like what it sounds like.But could this person be swayed to buy an office chair that already has built in back support, whichis something that pop and sales.Well, I don't know and you don't know, but it's worth trying it.So I want to select that also and put it into our account, put it into our group.Small desk chair.Interesting.I didn't think of that modern desk chair.I didn't think of that modern office chair.I didn't think of that pink leather high back mesh.Look at all these ideas that we didn't think of.Small office chair already.Small office chair similar to small desk chairs.Swivel.We thought of rolling, but I didn't think of swivel standing desk chair.I didn't think I did not think of that either.Like sort of higher chairs that could be used with standing desks when the standard desks are higher.So look at all these ideas and I comfy desk chair.These are high volume searches and I honestly didn't think of these searches when I was going out,setting out to build a pop in campaign.Now I want to ultimately add these into separate groups, but for now we could just save them all intomy plan so we could add them to computer desk chairs, or I can create a new ADD group.I'm just going to add them.I'm not necessarily structuring my ADD groups now.I'm not saying that white desk chairs is going to be in the same aggregate as computer desk chairs.They're going to be, of course, since we're going to be building out really good thematically relatedgroups of keywords, they're going to be in separate groups.But just for the sake of having them on sort of a virtual clipboard, having them in there, I'm justgoing to add them to the plan for now.That's typically what my workflow looks like.And you could continue to go down and down here and see what's going on and continuing it to add keywordsto your plan.And great desk chair, great office chair.It's a treasure trove of good ideas.Like this is ten times the amount of thoroughness that I would have thought of on my own.And I've been doing this for a long time because you just don't think of all the different permutationsand variations of keywords that other people are searching for.And you certainly will be surprised at some of the higher volume search terms.We started off by using a URL for search.In the next lecture, we're going to go and do some keyword searches, download some keyword ideas intoExcel, and I'll see you guys in a couple of seconds and the very next lecture.
