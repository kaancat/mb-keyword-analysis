# 23.6 How To Set Up Powerful Custom Schedules For Your Campaigns

Howdy Edwards fans love him back.As promised we're going to talk now about custom's scheduling.There's really one primary reason why you want to set up custom scheduling and that's because you don'twant to buy traffic to your website during certain times of the day or certain days of the week.For example let's say you're a service industry and you're a law firm and you're a startup law firmor your startup medical practice and you don't have the staff to service leads coming in at the middleof the night the way your business operates as people generally are urgent to get in touch with you.So they'll come on your Web site they'll call in they'll submit a form and they'll expect a responseback at you know shortly thereafter.And if you don't have staff during the middle of the night or during certain hours of the day you don'tthink that buying traffic will be a profitable proposition.So you don't want your ads to run on the other hand it's kind of annoying to have to go in and pauseand activate your campaigns and add groups whenever you want to pause and activate them.Well that's where custom scheduling essentially comes in.It allows you to set up times when sick when your campaigns are active when you'll be bidding on yourkeywords in the auction.Alternatively you might be an e-commerce business where you're selling products from your web site andyou can really sell products of at all times but you might have found in your data that historicallypeople generally are not buying during certain hours of the day they're just browsing.So you might want to keep your campaigns on because it's still good to have people you know becomingmore aware of your business that's an important factor to keep in mind.But on the other hand you might be you know budgeting your AdWords dollars to drive sales and not todrive brand awareness and you might not want to have your campaigns running during times of the daywhere people are not generally selling sometimes that's very late at night or very early in the morning.Things like that.So that's where custom scheduling comes in to set up custom schedules.You could either navigate to settings and then to add schedules on that tab will be here and it'll showyou your scheduling for all the different campaigns in your account.So one of the nice things about segmenting your campaigns out into separate campaigns is the abilityto set up custom schedules at the campaign level.Remember custom schedules are only set at the campaign level that the account level and not the ADDgroup level.So whatever custom schedule whatever schedule you apply to a campaign is going to apply to all the adgroups inside that campaign.So let's say we clicked on this furniture desk chairs USA campaign and now we're present with the customschedule we have set up for this campaign.As you can see the blue bars indicate the active times the campaigns are going to run.So by hovering over a blue bar we see Monday 10 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. we have the campaign schedule to runTuesday 3:50 and Wednesday 9 to 6.Those are went on.Those are the times our campaign is scheduled to run.Let's say I wanted to clear this out because we had set up this schedule initially.I could clean my custom schedule by selecting all them from the list and hitting remove and I'll geta dialog box click OK.And now I will have no custom scheduling.And if you see the blue bar indicates that I have my campaigns running 24/7 365 my campaigns are runningall day for each day of the week if I want to go ahead and add a new custom schedule I could just clickthe schedule button and click over here where it asks me to create a new custom schedule.Now I'm presented with the default option to add a time range for all the days of the week but say Iwant to just run my campaign Monday through Friday so if I click this drop down I have an option toselect Monday through Friday.Let's see I wanted to run them from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and I can choose my display clock which is12 hour or 24 hour.My time zone cannot be changed because the time zone is inherited from the Times on the account whichis what we set up initially.And now click save.Now we could see that I have my campaigns running Monday through Friday 7:00 a.m. to 3 p.m..Now this column will be here.These Collender are going to show you all the data you started accumulating for this time range thenice These Well the secondary potential option of setting up with this secondary benefit of creatingcomes to get custom scheduling is what we call bid a dustman's.Oftentimes you're going to find in your account there are certain times of the day and certain daysof the week that generate really good results they generate they generate good returns and they gethigher click through rate or you sell more products or you get more leads and you might want to thenbuild more aggressively during those times of the day.So for example let's say we found that Tuesday 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. are getting a lot of leads orwe're getting you know we're making a lot of sales something like that.So we could go ahead and click this little button over here in the adjustment column or if I click CancelI could select this bid I could select this time range which is Wednesday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and clickon set that adjustment over here and I get the same window or essentially the same window.So let's say I want to increase this by 30 percent.So $10 will become $30 and I'll click make changes.OK.So now Wednesday all my bids get increased by 30 percent Wednesday 7:00 a.m. to 3 p.m..But what about if I had a situation where I saw that only 7 to 8 a.m. on Wednesdays was really my hottesttime and that's the only time I wanted to make a big adjustment just from seven to eight so that I wouldneed to do is I need to edit my custom schedule first and then set my bed just adjustment during thosetimes.So let's figure out how to do that.I'm going to first remove this bit adjustment by making it zero Plug-In safe.And now I have a zero.And I'm going to hit as scheduled to edit my custom schedule.OK.So we have Wednesday 7 to three.So I want to first make this Wednesday 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. which is a one hour time frame.But I also want my -- to run from 8 to 3 so if I want to do that I need to create another day and makeit Wednesday and simply make it 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m..Click Save.Go back to.Now I have 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. here.I could make my custom increase my beard by 30 percent cut and click save.So now I have a big adjustment to 30 percent just from seven to eight.But my campaigns will still run from on Wednesday 8 to 3 at the normal bid.And if I go up to my little graph on top I will see this darker blue shade reflects my big adjustmentplus 30 percent bit adjustment and by hovering over the darker shade I will see exactly the detailsof that time frame and what the adjustment is so that's how we set up custom schedules.It's a very cool way to create a more thoughtful and a more profitable campaign.I could go ahead and remove them all I could I could I could click the button to remove when I clickon the schedules I usually will create one for each day separately so I'll add Monday and Tuesday andWednesday and so on and so forth.And do you have all the days of the week and this gives us a lot more control and a lot more nuancewhen it comes to creating our custom schedules because we don't need to just lump all the days togetherI can look at the data.I could go into the historical data the account.I could see which days and which hours are performing the best and I might have multiple times on Mondaybecause I want to do adjustments I might have multiple times on Tuesday so on and so forth and I'llset these all so let's say it just comes and go in here real random and just give you a sense of whatthe graphs going to look like.You know make just a bunch of different random changes hereand this oftentimes is what you know a will ultimately look like when you have your campaigns becauseyou're going to see buyers and leads are going to come in at different times.They're going to interact with your brand in different ways.So if we go up here and now we have this very erratic looking chart that's because we have a differentschedule set up for every day of the week.So listen some brands and some clients of yours or your business or whatever you're selling.It's very possible that you're going to want your campaigns on 24/7 and that's not a bad thing.Cousin schedules allow you to make the most of your data when you see certain trends.Tim but don't jump into a couple of my client accounts and take a look at what the screen looks likewhen there's actually data here.So here we're in an account that is has an interesting schedule there.They're bidding all the days of the week 24/7 but they have a we have set up a negative adjustment duringdifferent times of the week and different times of day.So if we look over here 12 a.M to 4 I guess negative 50 percent and for him to Iridium gets negative 80 percent.And this is because we saw historically that we've got a lot of clicks to the site during these timesbut we didn't get a lot of sales so we one of the Campion's to run picks we wanted to increase the awarenessof our clients brand but we didn't we weren't willing to bid as much or bid as profitably and that'swill that will generally be reflected in the click price over here we could see Saturday midnight to4 p.m. has a negative 50 percent pit adjustment.Average cost per click as a dollar 09.And Saturday 8 p.m. to midnight has no big adjustment in our average CPC is a dollar 82 so it's considerablymore expensive.And that's also reflected in that average position.So we see we have an average position of 1.7.And during that time in an average position of 2.5 during midnight to 4 p.m. and that goes straightdown the list and we could see for each time we have a custom schedule what the adjustment is what theClix impressions could Duraid cost per click conversions and so on and so forth.You know I could sort to see which time of day brought in the most amount of conversions the most amountsof sales and I could get a really good sense of my data.So that's what it looks like in a campaign that actually has data.And I but also once again go ahead and edit my schedule by coming in here and playing around with allmy settings.OK.So let's go into one more count or one or two other accounts.This account has a has a campaign that's running from 8 to 8 p.m. all days of the week.That's what we thought was best for this business that we've seen and also some there's been adjustmentsby days of Thursday has a plus 3 percent adjustment Friday has a plus 3 percent adjustment.And that's because we saw our greatest you know traffic the best the best engagement to our Web sitecame from Thursday and Friday for this company.So we created a a a minor adjustment for Thursday and Friday but their campaign is running all day long.And over here we once again could see our charts for clicks a change.I could see clicks verse impressions by customizing this graph.Okay.And I could see my data and compare and contrast it with the different time to the day and days theweek the campaigns are running.Here's yet one other account that's running Monday through Friday 4:53.And there is a positive bit adjustment.
