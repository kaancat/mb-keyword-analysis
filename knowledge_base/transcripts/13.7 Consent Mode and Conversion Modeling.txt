# 13.7 Consent Mode and Conversion Modeling

Let's talk through conversion tracking technique number six consent mode and conversion modeling.This one's a bit complex.It's newer and we need to discuss it.So I'm going to get out of here.Um, but consent mode and conversion modeling when a user does not consent to add cookies or analyticscookies.Consent mode using Google AI adjusts the relevant tags behavior to not read or write cookies for advertisingor analytics purposes.And without cookies, advertisers experience a gap in their measurement and lose visibility into userpaths on their site, and there are no longer able to directly tie users ad interactions to conversions.So Google came up with a solution called conversion modeling, which can help fill in the blanks inmedia measurement.At times when it's not possible to observe the path between ad interactions and conversions.So let's take a look at this example.In a thousand AD clicks, let's say 500 people consented, um, said yes, you can track me.Um, 50 consented conversions happened.So now we have 50 conversions reported were observed.Observed.So that click consent rate is 50%.Observed conversion rate is 10%.Now let's take a look at the 500 unconsented clicks.They had not we.We attribute nine Unconsented conversions through modeled, not observed conversion data.The modeled conversion rate is 1.8%.Um, that's what Google um, does.It's going to be more conservative.Um, but really, let's say there was 12 unconsented conversions, um, which was not observed by Google.So the true conversion rate there is 2.4%.But we're going to model Google is going to be more, um, conservative.And it's modeling out around 1.8%.So instead of 62 conversions being attributed to the 1000 AD clicks, we're going to have 59 conversionsattributed, which is still better than 50.Right?So we still got those nine additional conversions, but without overindexing on the conversion rate.The conversion rate without consent mode is around 5%, so 50 out of 1000 clicks actually converted.The conversion rate with consent mode is 5.9%, so we got 59 divided by 1000.The conversion uplift 59 divided by 50 minus one is 18%.So now through conversion modeling, we're able to to have an 18%, um, conversion recorded upliftwith conversion modeling even with people that did not consent.So conversion modeling is a great way for us and Google to be able to still track conversions, getmore data, um, without losing out on the Unconsented clicks option.In your specific conversion action, you can check the conversion diagnostics and see that consent modeis turned on and conversion modeling is active.And that's conversion tracking technique number six consent mode and conversion modeling.You will see these conversions reported in your conversions column.And if there's value associated it will also add the conversion value.
