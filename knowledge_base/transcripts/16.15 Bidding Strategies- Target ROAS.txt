# 16.15 Bidding Strategies- Target ROAS

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about target races and let's jump right into our slide.So this is another automated bidding strategy that tries to maximize or tries to spend your daily budgetin a way that hits your target.Return on ad spend.A couple of things to note.One is that return on ad spend is not the same as ROI, which is return on investment.So let's just quickly and I'm sure a lot of you know this, but just in case you don't, there's a slightdifference between ROI and ROI.So ROI accounts for your business expenses.It accounts for well, there's different ways you could calculate ROI, but but in essence, you wantto take a look at what your costs were, not only advertising costs, but maybe commissions, maybeyour cost of goods, maybe your shipping costs, maybe the cost of overhead, rent, salaries, etc.all the costs associated with running a business.That's how you get ROI.So straightforward ROI would be revenue minus cost divided by cost.So if my if I, if I generated 1200 dollars in revenue and let's say you're looking at a 30 day window,of course, it all depends on the time frame.So I would have 1200 dollars minus, let's say.I had a $900 expenses divided by $900, and that would give me my ROI.Now return on ad spend is really just asking me how much more money did I make for my specific ad spend?Right.So it's much simpler.It's total conversion value, which is revenue, right.Divided by cost of ads.That's your formula for that's your formula for race.And in fact, Google has a column that is just that.It's not called race.But if you go into your columns, you'll see something called SEO envy, conversion value divided bycost, and that is your race column.Now you could use a custom column to calculate ROI.So, for example, if you know that your margins are, say, a 30% and that's all your expenses, youcan multiply your revenue by 30% and you'll be able to use a custom column to output what your ROI actuallyis accounting for your ad spend, and we'll cover custom columns in a future lecture.But again, this automated bidding strategy is not looking to maximize your business profit.It's looking to maximize your your ROIs and using the formula in the calculator that I gave you, youknow what your raise has to be.I gave you a formula that that that will show you based on what your profit margin is, what your whatyour ROAS target should be in order to be profitable, your benchmark return and ad spend.And if you were to put that in as your target race, then you'd be able to actually use this biddingstrategy appropriately.So let's just run through objective scenario strategy here for return on ad spend.So the objective overall is if you're tracking more than one conversion action, let's say sales andphone calls and each conversion action, right.This is where things could get a little bit complicated, has a different value to your company.Targeting return and ad spend will aim to bid based on how much return you make on your advertisingdollars as opposed to targeting a specific cost per conversion.So when you're targeting by a CPA, it could be a little tricky because you have all these differentconversion actions that represent different amounts of value.But if you want to take a whole campaign and say This is the amount of money I'm spending, this isthe amount of revenue that I'd like to generate or the minimum, then you'll be in a good position touse target return on ad spend how it basically works.Google will predict which clicks will convert and how much those conversions will be worth to you.That's the from the algorithmic perspective.Again, you're not bidding based on a cost per click at a cost per click level.Google is going to choose exactly what bid to enter into the auction.And based on that click and based on what Google knows about your historic conversion rate and yourconversion value, you tell Google what each conversion is worth when you set up conversion tracking,or if you're running an E commerce store, you'll have dynamic conversion value which will read thetotal in the cart after somebody checks out and pull that information back into Google.But you must have conversion values configured.You cannot use this bidding strategy if you do not have conversion values configured.Campaigns using Target always need to have at least 15 conversions in the last 30 days, and conversionvalues need to be consistent within a range of few of a few days.Those are the basic conditions for using this return on ad spend automated bidding strategy.And I can tell you from experience, the more conversions you have in the account, the better thisthis automated bidding strategy will work.So if you're if you have less than five conversions a day, this is not a bidding strategy that willwork for you.So if you only have a few final level conversion actions where you let's say you're tracking ultimatesales and let's say your sales are $250 each.Right?And that could either be an average combined if it's dynamic or you just know that when you make a sale,your final conversion action, you're getting $250 of revenue, but you're only getting two or threeof those a day.And you want to try using an automated bid strategy?Well, there's a really great strategy you could use.You could figure out other steps that a person might take, other actions that could be counted as aconversion, although it's not your final conversion.So just for example, let's say in our example, our final sales is you're getting $250 of conversionand that is being tracked as a conversion in Google ads.Right.But you're only getting 2 to 3 of those a day, right?No.Good, because it's not going to be enough to allow you to use Target, CPA Target as a bidding strategy.But you also know from your historic data that 37% of people who, let's say, view your contact page.37% of contact page visitors end up converting right.They end up converting into a $250 sale over here.That means I could track contact page visitors as a.Conversion action.But more importantly, I can attach a specific value to that.So you just take $250, you multiply $250 by 37%, and that equals.Nine 3250 So I would be able to now put 9250 as my static conversion value for a contact page visitand maybe I'm getting 15 contact page visits a day or ten contact page visits a day or whatever it is.And now instead of having five conversions in my campaign, I now have 12, 13, 14 conversions in myaccount and I could potentially run one of these automated billing strategies more effectively.So that's always a strategy to remember use these micro conversion actions as long as you could attacha specific value, because targeting return on ad spend has to be using an accurate value attached toit.A scenario where targeted return to Aspen might be a good a good bidding strategy to try.So your company sells insurance.You also have a free e-book available for download on your site.So two things.We sell insurance and we have an e-book.The conversion rate from our sales form is 10%.Conversion rate on an e-book, let's say is 0.005%, and our average client value is $850.Based on what Google knows about the costs of our clicks and our Google ads, conversion rates for eachseparate conversion action, they're going to try and hit our target ROI.So again, using the same concept as we did before, we could know the value of a conversion rate froma sales form, it's $880 times 10%, which is $85.And we can know the conversion value for an e-book, which is half of that would be $850 times 0.005,not 0.005% or 0.05%.And you would get 40 to 50, right?So we would know the value of those conversions.Now how do you know what return on ad spend you need?Well, again, you have to reference back to that formula calculator that I gave you in the second lectureor the third lecture, you could plug in your profit margin, you could plug in these numbers and youcan figure out what return on ad spend you actually need.Now, what would this look like inside a real account?Let's go quickly take a take a check back into AdWords.So if I'm first setting up a campaign and I click on Target Return on ad spend, it's going to tellme that I can't set up Target.I can't run target return and ad spend bidding because I have to set up a conversion tracking.But let's go take a look at a live account.So if I go and select a a different bidding strategy here in a live account, I could click on target,return on ad spend, and then I can give a specific target that I want so I can put in 2,000% as a targetreturn on ad spend.I could use Google's suggestion of 5900, and this campaign is really, really dialed in.It's earning 50, $60 back for every dollar spent on advertising.So it's a really, really highly profitable campaign that typically works for most businesses.It might not work for every business.You might need to earn $100 for every dollar you spend, all depending on the dynamics of your specificbusiness in your account.But let's say this campaign is operating at a 6,000% return in Aspen.So for every dollar I spend, I'm getting $60 in revenue back.Say we would be happy to push more volume even if we have to bring that down to $30 back for every dollaror even $5 for every dollar.So I might want to get Google to spend more aggressively.So I might say I'll take a 500% return on ad spend if I know that $5 back for every dollar spent wouldwork for us and would work for this client.In which case I say Google, stop being so conservative, don't try to get me this 6,000% return onad spend and give me fewer clicks and less volume.Give me a a weaker return on ad spend still profitable for us, but weaker, and push my volume as muchas you can.Because typically when you tell Google they have more wiggle room that you're willing to take a lowerreturn on ad spend, you will get more volume.That's simply how that dynamic works because Google will enter you into more competitive auctions wherethose clicks will be more expensive, they'll be more competition.The conversion rate will likely be lower.The conversion, the cost per conversion will likely be higher, and as a result, your return on adspend will be less.So I have if I have a less so that follows.If I have a less aggressive return on ad spend target, I'll be able to spend more money and get morevolume, more traffic to my site.But of course, remember that whatever return and spend target you do set, it must be something thatis profitable for you.In the next lecture, we'll talk about the next automated bidding strategy, and I look forward to seeingyou guys there very, very soon.
