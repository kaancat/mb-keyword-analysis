# 14.2 7 Things You Should NEVER Do

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about the seven things you should never do as an effective modernadvertiser.Number one, restricting budgets.As long as you're hitting your daily budget while achieving target outcomes, you want to not give Googletoo little money to spend.We've seen a lot of campaigns fail because budgets are either spread too thin across most campaigns,or an individual campaign has too little budget.Google will give you a warning if your budget is being restricted and before increasing your budget,of course, make sure that your goals are being met, but oftentimes there's more head space to increasethat budget and generate more results.You want to at least we've spoken about this rule, but you want to be giving Google 5 to 10 times thebudget of your CPA.So if your CPA is $10, if you're looking to generate conversions at ten bucks, your budget shouldbe roughly $100 a day.That's not a hard and fast rule.You can definitely do less or more, but it's just a general concept that you need.Google needs enough data to optimize from, and if you're not giving Google the ability to generate1 or 2 conversions a day.At least then Google is going to get stuck and not really be able to generate you good results.Number two optimizing for minor actions.This is something that we see all the time.So you have a page view or you have a view of a key page.Or you have time on site.If you're only optimizing for those minor actions, that's what Google that is what Google's going tooptimize for.And that is what Google is going to give you.You want to optimize your campaigns for those core conversion actions like form submissions, phonecalls for lead gen businesses, and actual checkouts, or at least begin checkouts, starts of checkoutsfor e-commerce.Make sure you're tracking those conversion actions and you're optimizing for those actions.That doesn't mean that you should not also be tracking micro conversions, but make sure you're notoptimizing your campaign strategy for those micro conversions.Number three lack of continuous testing.We spoke about the need to test.And when you're not testing, you're not going to be able to uncover insights that will help your campaignsimprove.Number four neglecting data quality.So if your customer lists are not clean, if you're sending the wrong emails, if you're if you're sendingGoogle a whole list of customers, if you're sending Google a whole list of customers that actuallyconverted, but that that list includes customers who didn't convert.That's data.That's poor data quality.If your conversion tracking is not set up, that's poor data quality.Make sure that you understand that the data coming into Google is high quality and is accurate.Number five sticking to one channel campaign type or ad type, this is a mistake.Don't just run, search, explore Pmax don't just run Pmax.Explore a YouTube video YouTube video campaign number six over segmentation.When your campaign is built out into hundreds of campaigns and hundreds or thousands of ad groups,your results are going to perform more poorly.This is something that we've seen really change over the years.It used to be that a highly, highly segmented campaign structure with lots of campaigns and lots ofad groups, campaigns for specific specific devices, campaigns for specific times of days, campaignsfor specific keywords.That is no longer the case.Google wants to see more consolidated data so they have more information to make optimizations off ofautomatically using their AI, using their machine learning within accounts.So you want to make sure that you're not segmenting out campaigns by match type.Of course, you could have ad groups targeting thematically related groups of keywords or product categories,but you'll get a sense over time if you're being overly segmented.And just keep an eye out for for spreading that budget too thin across too much segmentation.And number seven micromanaging add accounts.You have to give the machine time to optimize and time to learn.So you don't want to be making a lot of key changes within the first two weeks of launching a campaign.If you make a bunch of big changes to bidding, you change your bidding strategy.You want to leave things alone for a week and a half, two weeks at least, and see how things run.Micromanaging.Every day you're coming in, you're changing the budget by a dollar.You're pulling this up and down.You're adding this keyword.You're adding this negative keyword.These are all good things in theory, but if you're doing it too frequently, you're going to continuouslykick Google's systems back into learning mode.And you're never going to you're never going to allow Google's optimizations.What what how they optimize.Leveraging AI, leveraging machine learning, leveraging the signals that they have access to.You're never going to let Google.You're never going to allow Google to get to the point where they understand the audiences, they understandthe campaign dynamics, and and it's hitting a stride outside of that learning phase.So keep an eye keep an eye out for getting a sense of an account is being micromanaged.So those are seven things that you should never do.Um, and in the next lecture we're going to talk about the signs of a scalable account.Looking forward to seeing you there in a couple of minutes.
