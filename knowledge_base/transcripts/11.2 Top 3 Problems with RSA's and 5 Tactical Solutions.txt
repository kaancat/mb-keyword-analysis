# 11.2 Top 3 Problems with RSA's and 5 Tactical Solutions

Welcome back.Let's discuss some of the problems with Rsas.And as you remember, responsive search ads.Well number one, generic copy.Boring generic copy.Most responsive search ads because you're giving Google 15 headlines and all these descriptions andand people are just not putting as much time and attention into what they're really saying.Most rsas lack differentiation, emotion and originality, and that results in generic, copy pastedads that fail to engage users.And that leads to a lower click through rate and a higher CPA, a higher cost per acquisition.Number two wrong ad copy.Because we're putting in so many different, um, headlines and the Google could sort of jumble thatorder around, you could wind up with information that's out of order, or it's just incorrect for thatad group and incorrect ad copy often results in lower conversion rates and user dissatisfaction, whichis exacerbated by Google's tendency to prioritize these misleading but high performing ads.And number three, untested ads.If you're not, if you don't have enough search volume every day, and most of us don't have enoughsearch volume to really accurately test all the different headlines and descriptions, these these rsasare going to mix and match all these different messages descriptions with every headline, and that'sgoing to ultimately fail to provide clear insights to you, the advertiser.And that's going to lead to inefficiency when you feel that a fewer actual headlines would have beenperformed, would have performed better and overall frustration.Now, so those are some of the problems with Rsas.Now, what do we do to solve this?How do we make our RSA responsive search ad experience better?So here are five tactical solutions to improve your RSA performance.Number one, know your audience.People prefer ads that directly address their specific pain points and their needs.So before you're writing your responsive search ads for your ad group, it's not enough to just knowwhich products and services and keywords are being highlighted and promoted in a specific ad group.You have to sort of have a degree of empathy for the searcher.What does he or she want?What stage of their of their life are they in?What are they interested in doing?Why do they want to buy this product?What are they struggling with?What are the pain points?Think about that and address that in your responsive search ads text.Number two use ad customizers.Think about dynamic keyword insertion.Think about countdown timers.Those ad customizers allow advertisers to efficiently update ad elements account wide in real time.And that's going to add a little bit of pizzazz, excitement, and uniqueness to your responsive searchads.Number three don't be afraid to be aggressive.Boldly highlight superiority over competitors to attract attention and win customers.This is important.Write like you're writing responsive search ads.It's a war.It's a battle.That doesn't mean you should.You could de let's say, um, you can't demean or or say anything that's untrue, but boldly screamyour values from the rooftops.What you offer.What's better about your brand?Why people love you.Why customers are enjoying shopping at your store.Number four test responsive search ads using variants.Google has a tool called ad Variations to dynamically test specific ad elements, so you might wantto test a final URL.You might want to test a pinned headline.So if you go into your if you go into your ad group and you click new AD and you click variant, youcould create a variation of an element inside an existing responsive search ad.So by testing your responsive search ads with additional elements, while on one hand you're addinganother variable for Google to test.But on the other hand, you could test a theory.So maybe a theory is just pinning one headline in the top spot all the time is going to be better,and now you have the option to test that.And lastly, use notes and labels.Notes and labels within the Google Ads dashboard allows for much more efficient data aggregation, filtering,automation, and performance tracking.So for example, if I'm going to label my scissors bold or I'm going to label my scissors facts or statisticsbecause I decided, hey, I'm going to really think about all the statistics that make us special,and I'm going to make sure that every headline and every description discusses statistics.And I have a bunch of different ad groups and a bunch of different campaigns and a bunch of differentresponsive search ads.Some of them are focused on statistics and some of them aren't.And I want to see if my statistics centric ad copy is performing better, gets a higher click throughrate or a higher conversion rate.I could label all of those scissors as statistics.I can create a custom label and then when I go into my reporting, I could look at my clicks, my impressions,my costs, my click through rate, my conversion rate, my etc., my CPA, my bounce rates, whateveryou want.I could look at that just for my.I could filter out by a label so I could say, I want to see all of my sales across my entire accountthat have this label applied to them, versus the performance of all of the rsas across my entire accountthat does not have this label applied to them.And that will give me insight.So notes and labels at the ad level, at a keyword level, at an ad group level, these are all waysit's it's ways of tagging assets in a larger account that allow you to easily to more easily analyzedifferences between, um, I would say assets that have different characteristics.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about branded search philosophy.It's a question we get all the time here at the agency.Should we be.Should we be running ads on our own branded traffic?And I will see you shortly for that exciting dialogue.
