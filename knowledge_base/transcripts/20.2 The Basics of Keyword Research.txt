# 20.2 The Basics of Keyword Research

How do Google fans?And welcome back in this lecture.We're going to go a little bit in detail about that.First of three, steps of creating a campaign with a really, really good keyword structure, and thatis keyword research.Before you plan and before you organize and before you launch your campaigns and before you build outa huge, massive account, you really need to start doing some keyword research to understand what keywordsare going to be effective, what keywords are going to be most profitable, what keywords will be experimental,what keywords are going to be your low hanging fruit bottom of the funnel keywords and how those keywordsare going to interact with search terms, and most importantly, how much you want to bid on each keyword,how much money you're willing to spend on getting clicks for certain keywords, and the anticipatedrevenue that will be generated from those keywords.And that's all part of what takes place during your keyword research phase.You should really be willing to spend time on keyword research.I think that in my opinion, in my experience, the the one element of campaign building that tendsto get ignored the most or given the least attention is keyword research.For some reason, it's like optimizing and looking at attribution models and doing all sorts of differentthings, building out accounts to be bigger and bigger, where people are not really doing the hardwork of researching keywords because it's difficult and it's time consuming, but it's really important.I guarantee you the keywords that you'll come up with off the top of your head that would be good foryour campaign are probably about 10% of the keywords that would work.Most people, if you're let's say, let's say we're advertising like this example for pop and we'readvertising office chairs.Most people would think that, oh, office chairs, rolling chairs, deck chairs, but people wouldnot necessarily automatically think of how to solve back pain.Right.That might be a keyword.It might be a top of the funnel keyword.You might need to send that traffic to a different landing page, but that's probably a keyword thatyou could turn a profit on, and you wouldn't think of that until you started doing some keyword researchand understanding the buyer funnel.My company runs the digital advertising campaigns for Forbes magazine, and when we took over the account,there were a lot of those bottom of the funnel searches, like Forbes magazine, business magazine,business subscription, things like that, best magazines for business.But when we started experimenting and researching, we saw a lot of search terms that were much moretop of the funnel.People looking for overall business advice, people looking for reading material for for traveling.So while those might not be the most intuitive searches and certainly those searches won't convert aswell, but conversion rate is not the only metric.The key metric is profit.So again, we've mentioned this before.Those are those more top of the funnel, what I call peripheral keywords that have less commercial intentfor your product are typically less saturated, they're typically less expensive.And we're going to reiterate that point a couple of times as we go along.But let's talk about keyword research, what it is, the goals from keyword research and some tools.And in future lectures, of course, we're going to go and do this in more detail as we build out theaccount, I'm going to show you how to use each one of these tools in depth.So bear with me beginning to understand your industry.That is what really keyword research is all about.You know your industry well, you know your customers, you know your you know your products well,but you might not necessarily know how people search for your products.And that's really what keyword research is all about.While you're researching keywords, you're going to start getting more ideas for ad groups, you'regoing to start getting more ideas for how to build out your campaign.Those earlier drafts and those diagrams that we spoke about that have your campaign and group structure,those might seriously change as you're doing keyword research and again, putting yourself in your customersshoes, being able to understand when a person decides they need your product, what is frustratingthem, what might be, what questions might they have that they're looking for answers for?That's really what triggers a buying funnel.Person has an issue.They have a need.Something frustrates them.There's something in their life that could be improved.They might have heard about a specific solution to that product.Now they're researching options.Now they're desiring.Now they're specifically intending to buy something.And at each different stages of those of that funnel, of sort of the psychological progression, peoplesearch search engines and they talk to search engines in different ways.So being able to put yourself in your customers shoes is part of what keyword research is about.You're going to again find all these new ideas that you might not think will be profitable in your campaign.But if you bid properly and you send them to the right content on your website, you could probablyfind a whole range of keywords.And that's sort of my goal in teaching.How to do keyword research better is not to teach you the most bottom of the funnel keywords.It's not to show you that when we're advertising to sell an office chair, we should use a keyword likecheap office chairs or expensive office chairs or high back office chairs.Those are bottom of the funnel.Those are intuitive.Most people can figure those out.But I'm going to my job is to teach you how to make a profit on keywords like how to solve back painor understanding lumbar support.Right.And figuring out a determining is that the type of click that I could be profitable because that willthat likely be somebody in my somebody in the market for my product?If so, in how long?If so, how much should I pay for that click?That's keyword research.The goals of keyword research are pretty straightforward.We want to start getting and this is like concrete stuff like before all this stuff is sort of psychological,a little bit less concrete.But here's some concrete things that are going to come as a result of keyword research volume estimatesfor each individual keyword.How many impressions and clicks can I estimate per month, per quarter, per year, per day cost estimates?How much will this keyword cost?Again, I want to make a point that all this stuff that we're talking about is moderated by match types.A keyword with an exact match.Match type might have different costs and volume estimates than a keyword with a broad match type.In fact, that will always be the case.We're going to talk about match types in detail.But keep in mind that match types always moderates everything.Moderates mediate everything we're talking about.So you're going to get cost estimates of what keywords will cost, what search terms will cost, howmany of them you'll get get a clear sense of the buyer's journey.That's another goal, like we mentioned.You're going to start understanding how long does it take for a person to first be introduced or decidethey are looking for an answer to this problem?And every and I'm going to have a slide that talks about the buyer's funnel awareness, interest, desire,action.Every single purchase in the world, the same way we talked about the behavioral model, where everybehavior be equals matched behavior equals motivation, ability to trigger every single purchase.You go through the buyer's funnel and we'll talk about that.So you get a better sense of your buyers funnel, you know your products, you know your services,but you may not know your entire buyers funnel.And then a really awesome thing is competitive analysis as you're doing keyword research, dependingon the tool that you're using, if you're using the Google keyword planner, if you're using Sam Rush,if you're using some the competitive analysis script that I alluded to in the beginning of the courseand have a full lecture on that later on, then you're going to start getting a sense of what your competitorsare doing, what keywords are they using to get traffic to their site, and the good competitors, thecompetitors that you admire.My I really I didn't talk about this specifically, but I have a healthy this is what I call it.Healthy respect.You should have a healthy respect for the competition.Yes, you should want to demolish them.You should want them.You want to leave them in the dust, destroy them, be better than them.But the good competitors have a healthy respect for them.So when you're doing your keyword research, you're going to start seeing which of your competitorsare using or are buying this search term or buying this traffic.What ads are they showing for that keyword and where are they sending that traffic to?So that's going to be a really, really, really crucial benefit of competitive analysis tools.Well, competitive analysis, rather, will be a really, really good benefit of keyword of good keywordresearch.Some of the tools we're going to go into detail, the Google keyword planner a few years ago, the Googlekeyword planner was a really frustrating tool to use.It wasn't fun.It wasn't that helpful.It's much better now.It's much cooler, it's much sleeker.There's a lot of cool things we can show you, and you're going to be able to get those volume estimatesand cost estimates from the Google keyword planner.Google Suggestions at the bottom of a Google search page.Google has suggested searches, related searches and autocomplete searches.I'm going to talk about each one of those.Those are good ideas to start getting more more ideas for both negative keywords and positive keywords.Sam Rush, which is a software that I like a lot, it's a paid software.We use this at our agency at a very high level spy food, which is not a software that I personallyuse, but I have used it in the past.It's a similar software.It's a competitor to Sam Rush.It's another one of these online softwares that you pay for that you start getting some really goodinsight into keyword, keyword research.And most importantly, ask people, this is something that everybody overlooks.Go to your colleagues at work.Go to your friends, your siblings, your children, your parents, whatever it may be.And if you're running a campaign for a carpet cleaning service or you're running you're running a campaignfor an educational program, you're running a campaign for a product that your dropshipping throughShopify or your Amazon store, whatever it may be, just go bring a computer, go to a sibling or acoworker and say, say you want to buy and just name your product.Don't give any more information.Do a search on Google three.Do this ten times with ten different people and you'll be shocked at some of the ways people talk tosearch engines.Your way of thinking about it is totally biased based on how knowledgeable you are about your products.And that's the case with every single, every single instance.I've seen this when you go and ask people who are not as familiar as you are with your products andyour services, and you ask them to search for Google and you don't give them any information, don'tlead them down a certain road to a certain search query.You'll see that people use abbreviations.People talk backwards, people write long sentences.Sometimes people just write one word, right?It's incredible the information and the the insight you can get if you just ask people and I imploreyou to do that.It's not easy.It's not it's it's it's not really that much fun and it's time consuming.And you have to sort of get up and interact with other people.I know not not fun, but I'm telling you, it's one of the best ways.In fact, I prefer I think this way will uncover more interesting insights than any of the other methodsthat I've mentioned.And we do this for our clients at our agency.It's like the most UN technological way of doing anything in a digital advertising agency, but it'sactually one of the most effective ways.So so I highly encourage you to do that.So that's keyword research in a nutshell.In the next lecture we're going to talk about keyword planning, then go on to keyword organization.We'll talk about them.I'm going to talk about match types in depth and then start getting back into the count and.Adding creating keywords, negative keywords, negative keyword lists.There's a lot to cover when it comes to keywords and how to manage them, how to actually manage theminside a Google ads account.So I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
