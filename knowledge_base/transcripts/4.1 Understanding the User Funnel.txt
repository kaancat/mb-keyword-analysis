# 4.1 Understanding the User Funnel

So let's talk about first understanding the user search query, audience targeting and messaging.These are three vocabulary words that you need to understand.So the search query it's the specific term or phrase the user types into the search engine.It's crucial to select keywords that accurately reflect what potential customers are searching for.So remember that the search query is not necessarily the same thing as the keyword.If you're selling fountain pens, you might put into Google as a keyword fountain pen for sale.That's your keyword.That's what you've told Google to use as a baseline for deciding which search queries trigger one ofyour ads.So Google might show your ad for a search query by yellow fountain pens online, even though the wordyellow wasn't in your actual keyword.So the search query is what the user actually typed in.Audience targeting that involves identifying and reaching out to the right audience based on their demographics,their interests and behaviors.So when we talk about targeting, it just means we're taking the total population and we're narrowingit down in scope based on parameters.Age is a parameter.A country or a city or a zip code or a mile radius is a parameter.Interest categories.Google has a and meta has hundreds, if not thousands of pre-built interest categories.You're interested in writing and literature and paper.That's an interest category.That's information and data that these systems have based on your previous browsing activity, licensingdeal with credit cards, other large data aggregate aggregators and DMPs data management platforms.And we talked and when we talk about audience targeting, ultimately we're going to ask what is thesize of your audience?Is your audience broad or is your audience narrow?And the way you get to either a broad or a narrow audience is determined by how many parameters youhave, limiting the audience.So by removing parameters, by by removing restrictions like age, gender, household income, interestcategories.You get a broader audience by increasing parameters.You get a narrower or smaller potential pool of total people that you could show your ads to.And when we talk about messaging, that just means what you're writing in your ads, what you're showingin your videos, what you're showing in your imagery, and how you combine image, video and text animationtogether to create a message.Now you want to tailor your message.When a user is in the top of the funnel, top of funnel users, people who are just becoming aware ofyour product or service, or maybe they're not totally yet aware at all of your product or service.That's what we consider top of funnel.Now top of funnel users.They need awareness focused messages, while bottom of funnel users need conversion focused messages.So let's go back to our fountain pen example.Now a fountain pen is something that most people are already aware of, but maybe they're not awareof our business.Maybe they're not aware of a new way that fountain pens are being made.Maybe they're not yet Interested in purchasing a fountain pen.So then the messages would be more about the lifestyle, the quality, the emotional and psychologicalpayoffs to writing with a fountain pen.It's elegant.It seems sophisticated.It's impressive.Maybe people will think you're smarter.Whatever it may be.As a person decides they want to buy a fountain pen, they're more interested in the specific featuresof a fountain pen.So maybe a fountain pen has an extra fine nib and it is 0.2mm wide, or it comes with three free inkbottles, or we have a better return policy than the competitor.Right.Those are all feature centric, conversion centric messaging tactics for people at towards the bottomof the funnel.They've already decided that they want a fountain pen.They're in the market, they're in the purchase portion of the funnel.And of course, messaging for them has to be tailored in a different way.Now users have different search queries depending on where they are in the funnel.And that and looking at search queries is a really good way to identify where somebody is in the funneland how to match ad copy in Google to different stages of the funnel.So here's an example.Um, somebody might search athletic sneakers okay.So that might indicate somebody a little bit higher in the funnel.They're not sure which brand they want.They're not sure which model they want.They're not expressing so much detail.New balance sneakers might be a search a search for somebody a little bit further along in the funnel.They've now identified a potential brand.It doesn't necessarily mean they're ready to buy today.Maybe they haven't picked out a model, but the messaging we would show to somebody in the market forNew Balance sneakers is easy to identify.We want to show them New Balance sneakers and then further deeper into the funnel, lower in the funnel.For an e-commerce journey such as this one, somebody might search New Balance sneakers.327 for women, they're identifying gender and they're identifying the model number.This search query indicates.Now it's not proving right.Every search query can be at any time used by anybody at any stage of the funnel.Somebody way up in the awareness phase might have heard of me.They may have heard the 327.They want to see a picture.They want to get pricing.They're not ready to buy.But as a general guideline, it's not a bad idea to look at search queries and to understand searchintent and funnel stage based on what the person is actually typing into Google.So when somebody searches for New Balance sneakers.327 for women, we now know we can tailor the messaging.Maybe we're offering free coupon codes or we're offering free shipping.We're giving whatever we're we're highlighting any other potential promotions.And of course we're showing them the correct model.So once you understand search queries and you understand the funnel, you could understand how to tailoryour ad groups, how to tailor your text ads and your shopping feed placements for users in users whoare expressing a certain degree of buyer's intent in their search query.In the next lesson, we're going to dive into understanding search queries in a little bit more detail.Looking forward to seeing you there.
