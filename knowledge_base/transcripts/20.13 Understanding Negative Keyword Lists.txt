# 20.13 Understanding Negative Keyword Lists

How do Google Ads fans?And welcome back to this exciting lecture where we're going to talk about negative keyword lists.Now, negative keyword lists are not a new concept.That's just a new way of implementing negative keywords.And the point of lists is to create collections of negative keywords that you want to reuse for multiplecampaigns.So you don't have to keep adding the same negative keywords to campaign.To campaign, to campaign.The most popular form of lists that I suggest that you all create right away is what I call an accountirrelevant.And you could label it as such account irrelevant.The your account irrelevant negative keyword list is going to consist of negative keywords that younever want to show up for.So let's say you're popping.A good example of that is free and probably a lot of you will have that and maybe it's going to be Amazonand maybe it's going to be e-book or maybe it's going to be downloads.It's if you're if, if, if, for example, one of our clients is AMC Television Networks, and that'soften confused with AMC movie theaters.So you might want for us an account relevant.Relevant would be like theater or tickets or showtimes.Well, showtime could be relevant.So that might be a campaign or ad group or popcorn.Right.So like a lot of you have to think about all the terms that might trigger searches for similar namedproducts.Another list that's very popular is competitor.Now you might choose to have competitor campaigns, but you might choose to not have competitor campaigns.There are cases where a competitor campaign makes sense to advertise on your competitor terms.So if you were, for example, Microsoft, you might want to have Apple as a negative keyword.Or you might choose if somebody searches for MacBook Pro to show an ad for the Windows Surface Bookor something like that.So and I always suggest testing competitor campaigns, but you might choose to have a competitor listand you have all your negative keywords of competitors and you could apply them to all your campaigns.You might have a list of specific brands.You might have a specific list of models as a negative keyword list.And I would suggest keeping these negative keyword lists as.Organized as possible.You could have a whole bunch of them.And it's always good to be able to look at your list of negative keyword lists and know what's in themand which campaigns there apply to purely for the sake of organization.Now remember, the only use of negative keyword lists is not necessarily account irrelevant terms,right?Say we're popping for example, and we have a negative keyword list that's going to be applied to allour chair campaigns, right?So for example, let's say we end up creating multiple desk chair campaigns.And you know, let's say let's say we we don't sell dinosaur chairs, but we do sell dinosaur desksor something or we don't sell for let's say let's say we don't sell wood chairs, but we do sell wooddesks.Right?So these wouldn't be a count irrelevant terms.But instead of having to add them manually to every individual campaign, I could have one shared negativekeyword list and apply this negative keyword lists to all my chair campaigns.Let's say I have let's say these are broken out by match type or their chair campaigns for differenttypes of chairs or for different different locations or different budgets or different hours of theday.Right.Whatever it may be, you might have again, you have your campaign broken out by many in many differentdimensions, and you might have similar structured campaigns for similar top level product categories.So now as I add another keyword to this list, let's add a keyword cheap, right?Because let's say I don't sell cheap shares, but I do sell cheap accessories.So I don't want I don't want cheap to be an account irrelevant because I know that I want to show upfor the search for cheap office accessories.But if I add cheap, then then automatically, if this if this negative keyword list was already appliedto one, two, three, four campaigns, then cheap will be applied as a negative keyword to all fourcampaigns right away.And all I need to do is add it once to my list instead of having to add it 1 to 3 four times to eachindividual campaign.That's the power of negative keyword lists.It's the best way of using keywords.I try to make sure my team and I don't add keywords at the campaign level if it just gets too messy.We add keywords at the add group level for the sake of sculpting, and you add keywords to lists andthen apply those lists to campaigns.It's the best and most efficient way of keeping track of all your negative keyword lists.Let's jump into Google ads and let me show you how to create and manage negative keyword lists in Googleads.So here we are back in Google ads.And there's a couple of ways that you could get to your negative keywords.I tend to click on my keyboard.If I click get, it pulls up a shortcut and I can start typing in negative keywords and I see negativekeyword lists and I can click on that and I go to my negative keyword list.I already created an account relevant.I could edit it, I could edit the name, I could save it.I could also delete it by selecting it and edit click remove and now it's removed and we can start fromscratch.As you can see here in this Google Ads account, there are no negative keyword lists yet, so I'm goingto go ahead and create the most important one, which are my account irrelevant.And I know that my account irrelevant is going to be applied to all the campaigns in my account.So account irrelevant.And I'll have things like free books, images in store near me local.DIY for do it yourself IKEA.Right.A lot of these are things that we added at the campaign level previously, but they should be addedto lists and I'll save that as my account irrelevant list.And now I want to go ahead and apply to a campaigns.Just by saving your negative keyword list does not mean it's apply to a campaign.As you could see over here, this has this list has nine keywords on it, but it's not applied to anycampaigns yet.So we go ahead and apply it to campaigns by selecting it by the checkbox.And then clicking apply to campaigns.If we apply to campaigns, we'll get a window of all the campaigns we have that we could apply to.I'll select it.If I had multiple campaigns, I could add I could add this negative keyword to multiple campaign campaignsand click apply.Now that I've created my negative keyword list, I could add keywords to my negative keyword list directlyfrom the search terms report.So let's go back to the search engine report.But before we go to the search report, I want to show you one more way to get to your negative keywordlists.And if we go back to our campaign overview and we'll go over to tools in the top menu, we can go overto Shared Library and click on negative keyword lists over here and get be brought back to the sameexact page.And over here we will see a list of the same ones.So if I added, let's say office chairs, negatives, and I had things like cheap on it and I had thingslike, you know, dinosaur and wood and metal, that's I don't sell metal chairs, but I do sell metalpens or metal file cabinets, whatever it is.That would be a negative keyword for all my office campaigns.I can save that.And I would see my whole list over here.Let's go to the search report and let me show you how to add keywords to the negative keyword listsdirectly from the search terms report.So I'm going to click get and I could go to search terms.Or I can go back to my campaign overview, go into my campaign, go to keywords and then go to searchterms.It would land me over here on search, on search keywords.Originally, I can navigate over to search terms and take a look at my search and report.So let's see, I'm going through and I say Restoration Hardware Office Chair Restoration Hardware isa competitor.They sell off the shares that are much more expensive and a distinctly different style.Even if they were in the same price range, I would still want to add Restoration Hardware as a negativekeyword because I know Restoration Hardware and it's a very it's a much more traditional style officechair, let's say, than the colorful, modern workplace offices that pop in cells.So I'm going to go over here and click and I want that to be an account negative.We don't sell anything that's like Restoration Hardware stuff.So I want anybody who searches for Restoration Hardware in their search term to not be shown in Afropop.And I do not want to spend money on that click.So I'm going to select Add as negative keyword.And now we could select negative keyword list directly from the search firm's report window.So instead of doing it at the campaign level like we did in the past, we're going to keep things organizedand add it to the negative keyword list and I'm going to add it to my account relevant list over here.I could choose from a list of all my negative keyword lists, so I'm going to choose a count irrelevantand I'm going to click Save.But we only did the exact match variation.I want to also do the broad match variation, so I'm going to keep it selected.Click Add negative keyword again.Go to a negative keyword list and just take out the brackets and office chair.So I have broad match restoration hardware.Without the brackets on my accountability list, click save.And if we do go to negative queue or lists, we'll see 11 keywords now on this account irrelevant list.I can go into it and here is where I could edit out keywords from that list.So let's say I decided I wanted near me to not be an account relevant anymore.I select the keyword I want to remove from the negative keyword list.Click, edit, click remove and then it's gone.Once these keyword lists get bigger and bigger, you're going to potentially want to download it.You could filter out different keywords that you're looking for.You could say match type, keyword, text and to to analyze it.We have keywords.We have negative keyword lists and accounts that are thousands and thousands and thousands of negativekeywords long.And sometimes we'll download it, say we'll be like a client will ask us, are we excluding search termsfor paper or are we are we including search terms for this brand?And, you know, it might be difficult to look at all the search terms we're excluding.So we'll download that into Excel.We'll run a function to find certain things, and then we could upload it back or we could just findthem in the account and remove them from there.So that's a basic overview of negative keyword lists how to use them, when to use them, the conceptof that account irrelevant negative list, which is really important, but then also lots of other negativekeyword lists that could be applied to either one campaign or multiple campaigns.And you could always edit the campaigns that are applied to.So if you go scroll down here, once you're in the negative keyword list, you'll see that it's appliedto one campaign.I could select the campaign name and remove list from selective campaigns, and now that negative keywordlist that I'm under, which is up here in the left hand corner account relevant, is no longer appliedto that campaign.I could go ahead again and click Apply to campaigns, apply to my campaign, click done and now it'sreapplied to my campaign.So you can really edit these things easily.You could edit the negative keywords, you could add negative keywords to them.You could also add negative keywords to a list directly from here by clicking the blue plus sign andadding a negative keyword.So let's say I wanted to add a negative keyword, Costco Click Save.I could edit from this window as well and it's really, really flexible way of managing negative keywordsin your account as your account scales.This pop in account could potentially have 50 search campaigns.Each of these 50 search campaigns could easily have 5 to 10 ad groups and using campaign level negativekeyword lists, account irrelevant negative keyword lists, and then add group negative keywords forsculpting is the best way to manage my best advice for you.The takeaway here is try to avoid individual campaign level negative keywords as much as possible becauseyou could typically use negative keyword lists instead.And they're typically it's going to be a much, much more efficient, better way to organize your negativekeywords as you scale and keep track of them.So my suggestion as an exercise is if you haven't done this already, create an account irrelevant negativekeyword list.Use some of the research tools for negative keywords like Google suggests Google suggestions relatedsearches.Swivel your search terms report and start adding account irrelevant negative keywords with the rightmatch types to your negative keyword lists.I will see you guys very soon in the next lecture when we're moving on to the next topic and gettingdeeper into different keyword research for positive keywords, different techniques that we could use.I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of seconds on the other side.
