# 16.9 Understanding Advanced Location Options

How do you lads fans and welcome back and this lecture we're going to talk about the advanced settingsunder location option.So let's go jump back into our computer right away and we'll take it from there.After you've configured your location targeting, remember we set up some location targeting for poppin.You have this little twirl down menu called Location Options and other location options.You have some advanced targeting options for targeting and excluding.Basically, there's different ways you could treat your targeted locations and there's different waysyou could treat your excluded locations.And it matters because it will significantly impact where you're at show and who sees your ad.So you have three options under target, and these are options that are applied to the locations thatyou target.So in our case, if we're targeting the entire United States minus a couple of locations as a country,then how which option we select here will apply to that entire targeted location?So we have three options.People in or so who interests in your targeted locations recommended people in your targeted locations,people searching for your targeted locations.Now, why do you think Google recommends the one that they select by default and by now?You should have a pretty good idea of what's going on here.They're trying to get you to spend more money.A good rule of thumb, and I say there's no hard and fast rules, and that's true.But a good rule of thumb is whenever you see Google recommended, whenever you see Google recommendingsomething, do the other thing.And I love Google and and obviously I built a business on Google and fair enough that they're recommendingwhat they recommend.And that's that's fine.I'm entitled to recommend my Google ads course over somebody else's Google ads.Of course.Right.It's business.But I think that in most cases, selecting people in your targeted location is the right way to go.Because if you show people in who or who show interest in your targeted location, I could be targetingNew York.Let's say that's my let's say I only want to show ads in New York.But if somebody types something about if somebody sitting in California or somebody sitting in Europeand they type something about New York or they somehow express interest in New York, my ad might beeligible to show in.The problem with those types of settings are Google is pretty opaque with what those rules governingthat are, you don't really know.It's like if they express interest in a targeted location, it doesn't have to necessarily be in thesearch term.It could be based on their Google Maps settings if they if they've searched for locations previously.Right.It's like it's really, really hard to really know exactly what Google is getting at when they do that.But let me jump into some slides and I want to I want to just use some concrete examples to help youunderstand really clearly what these settings are.So the first option that Google shows you by default reach people in searching for or who show interestin my targeted location.And of course, these slides will be available for download so the person doesn't actually have to bein your targeted location in order to see your ad again.Showing interest is up to Google to decide the data could be collected from multiple different sources.It's the default option used by Google.It will get you to spend the most money quickly and unless it specifically makes sense for your businessin particular, do not use this option.Let me show you an example of where this actually might be a good targeting option to use.So here we have an example.The keyword is car rental and the target location is Los Vegas.So let's say you run a car rental company.So we have search term user location and is your ad eligible?Here's a fun little exercise.We'll do this all together.So let's say the search term is car rentals.The user location is in Las Vegas.Is your ad eligible?Of course your ad is eligible to show.That's obvious because the person is sitting in Las Vegas.Vegas car rental is the search term.The user location is is Chicago.Right.So let's say my keyword is car rental and let's say this is an exact match keyword.I'm telling Google that I only want to show ads when somebody searches for this exact this exact configurationof words.So car rental, not car rental.And I don't want to jump too much into match type because we're going to spend probably hours talkingabout keywords and match types and all that stuff.But just a quick, quick in concept, exact match means that I only want you to show an ad when somebodysearches for exactly what my keyword is.Exact match search term has to match up exactly with car rental and unfortunately exact match doesn'treally exist anymore the way it used to exist, exist, whatever.But that's for another time.But anyway, somebody who is sitting in Chicago and they search for Vegas car rentals is my ad eligibleunder this targeting location setting?Yes, it is.And this is an instance where it might make sense, right?Because if you are a company in Vegas.That offers car rentals.You're probably offering car rentals to people who are traveling to Vegas, and very often people willbook or choose their car rentals before they travel.Right.This is a this is an example that could be applied to many different industries that in the travel space.So this would actually be the right targeting method for that type of business.Because then if somebody expresses interest in car rentals with my keyword in Vegas, my ad my ad iseligible to show.One more example.Rent-A-Car Vegas might be the the key word and somebody in Paris.Right.Is my ad eligible to show?If you guessed it is, then you guessed right, because that is how it works in this setting.I think you'll understand this setting now.Right.People expressing interest.Now let's take a look at the next option, which is my recommended option.Reach people in your target location.So you're only showing ads to anyone who is considered to be physically located within the area thatyou've targeted.I want to also point out at this point that Google's location based, user, location based targetinggets less and less accurate the narrower you get.So if you and there's different percentages and I used to sort of throw out different percentages thatI thought of Google's accuracy, but it's changed over time.If you're targeting a country, then you're in the 90% accuracy.Users who are in those countries will only see your ad if you get down to the state level.I would probably say it's like, you know, 75 to 85% likelihood city, metro area, neighborhood zipcode.You know, that gets a little bit and a little bit less accurate.But you're still, by and large going to be showing ads to the people that you want to show ads to.So if people outside your targeted area include terms related to your targeted locations in their searches,they won't see your ads.You're telling Google, I only want to show ads to people who are actually in my targeted location,regardless of what interests they express.This setting will obviously give you much more control over who sees your ads.If I want to show ads to people in this neighborhood, if I want to show ads to people in New York,I'm going to be specifically showing ads to those people.So it's fantastic.It's the best option for most businesses, in my opinion.Let's go take a look at an example.So let's say the keyword here is travel agents, right?I want to show ads when people search Google for travel agents.My target location is the state of California.We have search term again.User location is your ad eligible.The first example, say the search term, somebody searches for travel agents in California and theyare in Las Vegas when they perform that search.And let's say my keyword is a broad match, meaning it doesn't have to be an exact match.So just take that out of the equation for now.Is your ad eligible to show to that person in Vegas?If you guessed no, then you guessed correctly.Say somebody searches for travel agents and they are in San Diego when they do the search.So, yes, their ad is eligible because they're in California.If somebody searches for best travel agents in LA, they specifically search for the location and they'rein Chicago.When they perform the search, are they eligible?If you guessed no, then you guessed correctly.And you're really understanding this concept.Now there's a third targeting option, a third way that Google could handle your targeted locations,reach people searching for, or who show interest in your targeted location.And this is a really interesting one.So this the way this works is that you're showing your ads to anyone who shows interest in your targetedlocation by either searching for viewing content about or having settings related to their targetedlocation.Actual physical location of the user is completely ignored.So if I have.Targeting settings set up in my campaigns for California and New York, the country, this and thatthat's ignored outside of the context that I'm telling Google that I want people to show interest.I want I want people to show interest in these locations in order to show my ad.But the users can be anywhere in the world.The physical location of the user is a non factor in this setting.It's pretty interesting.It is an interesting targeting option for some specific use cases.It's not an option that most businesses will use.So let's take a look at a quick example where I think this might actually be a good targeting settingsto potentially use.Say I sell concert tickets.The keyword that I'm targeting is concert tickets.And for example, let's pretend that it's exact match.I only want Google to show that keyword when it's exactly that keyword, just for example, that's thekeyword in the account.And I'm targeting New York.I think this is an interesting targeting setting to use because I don't really care necessarily wherethe person is in the world when they're searching.I just want them to be showing expressing interest in tickets for New York events or shows because that'swhat I'm selling.People might be buying them for me to resell on their own.People might be buying and traveling to the city.Right.So let's go through a couple of examples here of search and user location.Say the search term is in this example.Concert tickets for sale or concert ticket sale.And remember, it's my keyword above is exact match.I only want that variation to show.So concert ticket sale.The usual location is in New York.Is my ad eligible to show that?No, my ad is not eligible to show.So now contrast this with the previous targeting setting where my ad would be eligible to show it becauseI want to target people in my who are in my targeted location or who express interest in my targetedlocation that actually can override the exact match setting.Remember in that previous example where the ad would have been eligible to show based on the user locationif they're in New York, but because in this targeting setting, user location is completely a non factor.Google defaults to my exact match match type and would not show this ad if the person is in New York.Quite interesting and this might be useful to use because perhaps I don't want to sell tickets to peoplein New York because I know that my profit margins are much lower or or there's a much more saturated,competitive, competitive landscape.And I know that I'm going to have to pay too much in the auction per click in New York for concert ticketsin New York.And I only want to sell it outside of the area where I'm actually where the shows are performing.Right.That's an actual use case that could happen quite often.Say somebody searches for New York City concert tickets and they're in London or in the U.K. Then whathappens?My ad could show because a person in their search term is expressing interest for New York City concerttickets.Right.So they're outside of my targeted location.But remember, the user location is a non factor.What matters is are they expressing interest?And that could override my exact match match type.So New York City concert tickets, my ad would be eligible to show if my keyword is Manhattan concertsand the user location is in Chicago.Is my ad eligible to show?If you guessed yes, then you guessed correct.So you should now have a pretty good idea of these three different targeting settings and how differentthey really are.I think a good example would be to pause the video for a few minutes and to think about your own businessand make an argument or a use case why each of these targeting locations may work or may work againstyou, may work for you or against you.And I'll tell you this, in most cases, when I set up campaigns and my and we set up campaigns hereat the company for clients, it's not always the simplest answer.There's pros and cons to each of these targeting settings.If you get imaginative enough, you'll see that in each of these targeting settings, you could probablycome up with a use case that it would work out to your benefit.But you have to think about the overall, the average.What are most people going to do?What's going to happen most of the time?And based on that thought process, that analysis you choose the targeting setting that makes the mostsense for you.I actually have one more example here on my slide, Manhattan concerts, that's the search term.The user location is in New York.Is your ad eligible to show again?Of course, yes, because the person is expressing interest in New York in that targeted location intheir search term.Now, let's quickly take a look at the advanced settings for exclusions.So we have advanced targeting options for exclusions.The first option is exclude people in searching for or viewing pages about my excluded locations andviewing pages would relate to display network is the content of that page display network.So that's the my personal recommended option.If your keyword, for example, is USB cables for sale and you exclude Detroit, your ads won't showfor USB cables for sale if the user is in Detroit.And your ad also won't show if a user is in another state and searches for USB cables for sale in Detroit.Right.So if I'm meaning you're getting the most exclusions, your exclusions of Detroit is taken, let's saythat I would call it's taken the most seriously when you have this option selected.So I'm excluding people in Detroit or if they're searching for information about Detroit.So again, if the user is in Detroit, then doesn't matter what they search for, they're not goingto see my ad if the user is out of Detroit and they're in my targeted location, but they search forUSB cables for sale in Detroit and they express interest in excluded location.Right.It's the flip side of the previous targeting setting before we were talking about expressing interestin a targeted location over here, we're talking about expressing interest in an excluded location.So you get the most exclusions, the most limitations set on your exposure of your targeted settingof your ads through through exclusion settings using this recommended option.The second option down is exclude people in my excluded location.So again, back to the previous example, using the above example, if a user outside of Detroit searchesfor USB cables for sales in Detroit, your ads will be eligible to show.Now, of course, this example with USB cables is a bit arbitrary, but think about your business againif you're going to exclude locations first think of why am I excluding that location?Am I excluding that location?Because that location and people interested in that location is no good for me?Or do I just or is it some compliance thing and I just can't show ads in that location in which youwould choose the second option, but in most cases you would choose the first option.I'm always for like my my philosophy is err on the side of underspending error, on the side of notwasting money.You could always change these settings later.So the reason why I recommended the targeting second the targeting setting that I recommend becauseit takes your targeted locations the most seriously.The reason why I recommend the the exclusion settings that I recommend is because it takes your exclusionsthe most seriously.It gives you the most limitations.There's a lot of volume on Google, and in most cases you're going to have a lot of volume to get.So all I'm doing is recommending the settings that will work out on the side of erring or erring onthe side of being more cautious with your spend.But of course, if you have a specific reason why you think a different setting should be used, thenby all means go ahead and use that setting.But if you have a specific reason why, why a certain setting should be used, that's not one of theones that I recommended.You now have a very good understanding of what those settings are, how they work, why they're there,and you'll be able to make the right choice for your business.Let's quickly jump back into Google ads and we will select the appropriate targeting settings for ourfictitious campaign.I'm going to select people in your targeted locations.I'm going to keep that.I want people only in the United States searching for my online office shares because I cannot shipit to anybody else.And for the few people who are sitting in Australia who are searching to send it further to their motherin New York, fine.Yes.There are some use cases that I might want to get that impression, but because that's not the typicalway that will play out.I want to search.I want to only show ads to people in my targeted location, and I want to exclude people in or who showinterest in your excluded locations.Recommended.And to Google's great credit, they actually recommended the option that's the most economical for you,the advertiser.So we must we must show appreciation where appreciation is due.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about quickly setting up our languages and moving on intobudget and other exciting, exciting settings for our first Google Ads campaign.I hope you're enjoying this so far.I certainly am.I appreciate you staying with me this long.We're just getting started.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the next lecture.
