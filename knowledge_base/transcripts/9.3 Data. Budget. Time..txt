# 9.3 Data. Budget. Time.

For effective machine learning, there are three things you need.You need data.You need money, and you need time and patience.That's for.But time and patience are one, so make sure you have high volume of valuable and meaningful conversiondata in every campaign.Okay, so if you're not generating conversion data, you're not feeding conversion events back intoGoogle.Your smart bidding is not going to improve.High quality conversion data means you're tracking setup is configured correctly.When we say close the feedback loop, that means when a purchase comes through, we're feeding Googleback that a purchase event took place, and we're feeding Google back the revenue that occurred forlead gen.We're telling Google when a form was submitted.But even in an ideal world, using Salesforce or HubSpot or whatever CRM you might be using, you'reletting Google know you're capturing the gold in the form, and you're letting Google know maybe a dayor a week or a month later if and when that individual lead turned into a client, and the revenue andthe profit associated with that deal.Optimize your campaigns for meaningful business goals so you don't want to have a conversion event trackinga click or a scroll depth usually.But if there's a download for a white paper, or if there's a button that says get directions to a store.Those might be meaningful goals that you can and should track as conversion.Let's talk about volume of conversion data.Google recommends having at least 15 to 30 conversions per month per campaign for effective data aggregationand machine learning in a campaign.Without that amount of data, without 15 to 30 monthly conversions in a campaign, the algorithm isnot going to have enough data to optimize and to make accurate predictions off of.And lastly, consolidation is key in modern advertising strategies, where in the past we used to havemaybe thousands of of ad groups, hundreds of campaigns, tens of thousands of of keywords spread out.The modern account setup is is a much more consolidated approach.Try not to segment campaigns or ad groups too much unless absolutely necessary.As a rule of thumb, do not segment campaigns by device, typically not by match type geographics genderagain, unless it's absolutely necessary.You might have a use case.You might have a company where where gender is a is a dramatic axis and performance is very, very different.Whether it's a woman or a man.You might have the same case for devices, but Google is going to get good enough to understand whatdevices and what users, what times of day, in what places are likely to convert.Because again, remember the smart, the the the the traditional approach to Google Ads setup was we'regoing to use our own human inputs like manual CPC bidding, geographic targeting and bid bid adjustmentsup and down.Too much to mould to a very great extent.How the auction works.The modern approach is to release Google from as many of those restrictions as possible, and let Google'smachine learning, with the data that we give it, optimize using thousands of signals that we don'thave access to.So when we talk about budget, this is one of the sticking points often with clients when it comes tomachine learning, because people just don't trust machine learning, and rightfully so.It's a closed box system.It's a black box system.It doesn't always work.Google is absolutely not transparent with how exactly how the smart bidding systems work.But ultimately, I think and I say this with a pretty good deal of confidence, the number one reasonI see campaigns not working, why I see client campaigns failing is because they shut them off too fast,and they did not invest enough money into them.You got to give the campaigns enough budget to gather data and to gather learnings.If you're bidding with target CPA, your daily budget should be 10 to 15 times your target CPA.That means if you have a $20 CPA target, you have to be giving Google at least $200 a day in budget.If you have a target CPA of $100, your daily budget should be 1 to $1000 to $1,500.Target Roas 10 to 15 times your average order value.That should be your daily budget.Other bidding strategies similar thresholds apply.Aiming for 10 to 15 x the target metric.So if you're on well if you're on maximize clicks, you could give a more flexible budget because Googleis just trying to get you the most clicks within that budget.But the main idea here is volume is key.The more budget, the more data, the better the machine learning will ultimately perform.Time, budget and time.Everybody says we wish we had more money and we wish we had more time.And it's the same thing with Google.Google wishes they had more money and they wish they had more time and advertisers.If you build a smart campaign and you're sending Google good conversion data, you have to give it moneyand you have to give it time.So when you understand the conversion journey, larger ticket purchases or lead cycles typically dohave a longer conversion journey, whether it's a longer sales cycle or it just takes somebody moretime before they submit a sales form with a service based business, there are cases where it's moreimmediate.A 24 hour locksmith is going to get clicks and conversions within a span of moments or minutes.But when you have those longer lead cycles or they purchase, consideration for an engagement ring islonger.Before you evaluate results, make sure you allow time for that data to be attributed back to the campaign.In the meantime, while you're waiting for more of that conversion data to filter in, you can lookat micro conversions or proxy metrics.So a micro conversion is really just a proxy for a sale.So if I know that if I know that one out of ten people who make it to my contact page fill out a form,maybe I'll track contact page visits as a conversion, and I'll send that information back into Google.That would be a smart thing to do in the traditional approach.There was no reason to do that because I'm not.My goal is not, uh, my goal is not to generate contact page views.My goal was to generate form submissions in the modern approach.Sending high quality signals back into Google could be a very, very smart way of giving the algorithmsmore information to optimize based on number two, understand the learning phase.The learning phase is when Google Ads gathers data to optimize performance.That usually takes two weeks, and if you make any major changes, the learning phase is going to restart.Major changes could include adjusting budgets, adjusting targeting, rewriting your ads.Those types of changes will kick the campaigns back into a learning phase.So it really is worthwhile to give a campaign two weeks before you make any decisions, before you make,before you touch it in any way.And every time you make big changes in the campaigns of the account like update updating, conversiontracking, you re-enter the learning phase, budget or target adjustments.Less than 10 to 15% don't typically send the campaign back into the learning phase, so that's somethingwhich is worthwhile to keep in mind.And one other thing to keep in mind Google is constantly testing and optimizing campaigns.And under the hood, Google is typically allocating 10 to 20% of the budget for testing different variationsand strategies.So you might see some fluctuations in performance.You might see things working up and down, but ultimately, 10 to 20% of the daily budget you give Google,Google is going to be sort of reckless with it.They're going to test different ideas with it.They're going to test a new audience.They're going to test audiences, users, search terms, placements, combinations thereof, differentsignals that they might want to to, to explore.They're going to test to see if they can learn something new, that they can then incorporate into youryour primary budget.
