# 7.2 Google Ads Bidding Strategies

Now.Now that we understand sort of the key ideas in managing cost, let's dive into managing costs withthe different bidding strategies.So here we have nine different bidding strategies, all available when you set up a Google Ads campaign.First we talk about we have maximized conversions.This tells Google to get the highest number of conversions within your budget.So if I give Google a daily budget of $100 and I say I want you to maximize conversions, you're tellingGoogle you want Google to try to get the highest volume of conversions.What's important here is that they're ignoring conversion value.They're not looking necessarily to get the highest return.So you might have a store that sells $2 products up to $2,000 products.And of course there's different product margins associated with them.There's different lifetime values associated with different products across your catalog.But if you're running a campaign that says maximize conversions, and this is something which is veryoften used for lead gen, where leads might have a different value, but it's really hard to associatea value with a lead before that lead comes in.So maximize conversions could work really well in those service based businesses.But you're basically telling Google, get me the highest volume of conversions.Contrast that with the second bidding strategy maximize conversion value.This is a strategy to adjust bids to achieve the highest total conversion value within your budget.So if Google feels that we can generate more revenue with higher ticket items and therefore a differentaudience cohort with fewer conversions, then under maximize conversion value, that's what Google isgoing to try to optimize for.Maximize clicks.The third strategy this is a bidding strategy where you're instructing Google to get you the most possibleclicks within your given budget.So this is useful if you're not as concerned with conversions, but you want a lot of traffic to yoursite.You really want people coming to the site, being exposed to your to your messaging, becoming awareof your product.Maximize clicks is a campaign that will help you generate the highest volume of clicks.So Google's going to go after the lowest hanging fruit in the auction where the clicks are cheaper.So Google is going to try to find not necessarily the highest quality keywords in terms of conversion,in terms of people who might take an action today, but Google is going to try to get you the most amountof people overall for your given budget, target CPA, and target Roas.These are two of the most popular, and I would say the most important bidding strategies under Google'shood.These are the ones you're going to test the most.You're going to use the most.You're going to understand the best target CPA.As it sounds, it's telling Google to get as many conversions as possible at or below a specified costper acquisition or cost per conversion.So if my conversion action is a sale for ecommerce or my conversion action is a form submission forlead gen target, CPA is, I'm going to tell Google how much money I'm willing to spend for that action.And this is this goes back to when we talked about what manual CPC bidding is and, and how the ideathat averages are always wrong and why target CPA is better.Because remember what we said, you don't really care what your CPC is.It's true.You care about what you spend.But more importantly, you care about the returns.You care about how much money you've earned from that spend.So target CPA is is your way of saying, you know what, Google?You could have the reigns.You could set those bids for me.And keep in mind, Google still sets a bid every time there's a search.You don't see that bid.You don't control that bid under target CPA or target Roas or the other or the other bidding strategiesthat we just mentioned.But Google will set that bid for you.But you're telling Google that the results should be optimized.The campaigns and the bids and the performance and the audience targeting should be optimized to generatethose form submissions at $120 a form submission, or $250 or $30 a purchase that's target CPA and thesister of target CPA is Target Return.So instead of trying to limit Google with a cost per action, you're trying to get Google to optimizea relationship.The relationship between spend and revenue conversion value in Google, your conversion value columnis your revenue column Um, and your total conversion value divided by your cost gives you your returnon ad spend.So that's a relationship target.CPA is a KPI target.Target Roas is a relationship.So you might tell Google I want A3X Roas or a 1.5 times Roas or a 600 times Roas.A 600, a 600% Roas is for every dollar.If I spend $1,000, I want you to only think that your results were good.If we generated $6,000 of conversion value from the campaigns manual CPC, we discussed.This is a strategy that lets you to set your own maximum cost per click bids for every one of your keywords.This gives you full control.You won't pay Google more or less than you're willing to pay for any click.This does not use smart bidding or automated bidding signals.And that's what you're really missing out on.Now, I will say that there are many examples where manual bidding really makes sense.You might find a specific keyword or a group of keywords that are super, super relevant and you knowhistorically that they perform and you don't want Google trying to figure out how to get them to perform,or if they're performing well enough.You just know that you want every single person searching for these keywords or these searches to beon your site, to be seeing your ad.So you might you might create a campaign or an ad group with a small group of those keywords.And you might give them a very, very aggressive, a very expensive, high, strong bid to make surethat you get the top spot or the top two within the top two spots and you get maximum impression share.You get maximum visibility for your choice.Keywords and search terms a portfolio bid strategy.This is a this this is a a a a mechanism inside Google that allows you to group together multiple campaigns,ad groups, and keywords to optimize performance across an entire portfolio using a chosen, chosenbid strategy.So the same way an ad group, or rather the same way a campaign houses, multiple ad groups or portfoliobid strategy is choosing whether it's target CPA or target Roas, and it's applying that to multipledifferent campaigns.It makes it easier to manage Adjustments.Um, but it also helps you get broader data, especially if your campaigns are split out into, um,narrower and thematically related groups of keywords.A portfolio bid strategy could be a really easy way for you to tell Google, saying, look, in thesefive campaigns, across the five campaigns, we're looking for A3X return or a $90 CPA Target Impressionshare.This is a strategy that sets bids to achieve a desired percentage of available impressions on the topof the page, or anywhere on the Google search results.So you might be looking more for an awareness play and you say, hey, I want to get my message outthere as cheaply as possible, um, as broadly as possible.So you might go to you might go to Google and you might say, hey, um, I'm looking for a certain Roas,or I'm looking for a certain volume of clicks, but target impression share is no, I just want my messageto be saturated.I'm not primarily concerned with clicks.I'm not primarily concerned with Roas.And I would say that target impression share is the most least used bidding strategy.I don't really use it ever.We're not using it for any of our clients, so we're not going to spend much time talking about it.Enhanced CPC.This is sort of a a bigger brother to manual CPC, so it's still a strategy where you set bids for everysingle keyword.You still set your own manual Max CPC bids for all your keywords, but Google will automatically adjustyour manual bids up or down to help maximize conversions, increasing the bid based on the likelihoodof a conversion, or decreasing the bid based on Google's thinking that this is not going to lead toa conversion.There are.There is no cap on how much it can increase the bid, but it does aim to stay within your daily budget.So even though Google could increase and decrease the bids at will using enhanced CPC, Google willstill respect your actual daily budget.The next lecture, we're going to talk about the case for smart bidding and some of the the more compellingreasons why you might want to develop smart bidding or choose smart bidding as you configure and optimizeyour campaigns.
