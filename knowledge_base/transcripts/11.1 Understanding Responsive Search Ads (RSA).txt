# 11.1 Understanding Responsive Search Ads (RSA)

Welcome back.Let's learn about responsive search ads in more detail.This is the default full powered search ad type that's going to be active in all of your search campaigns.So first let's review what is a responsive search.AD responsive search ads is a type of Google ad that that allows advertisers to create flexible adsthat adapt to show more relevant messages to users.By giving Google multiple headlines and multiple descriptions, Google's machine learning algorithmsautomatically test and determine the best performing combinations to show in response to users queries.So it used to be when you created ads, you would tell Google to rotate ads or to optimize for betterperformance.This is different.Instead of having ten individual ads, you're going to have hundreds or thousands of possible ad combinations.By giving Google a bunch of headlines, a bunch of descriptions, a bunch of different assets all inone actual ad unit.And what to keep in mind is that you can still have multiple responsive search ad units inside any givenad group, but even just having one really good responsive search ad could be very effective and evenmore effective than having ten individual standard text ads like we used to be able to have in ad groups.So over here on the picture, we see two sponsored search results for this search window replacementin Vancouver.These are examples of responsive search ads that both look different.They have different extensions, different description lengths, different headline lengths.But these are ads that are formed through responsive search ads.So even though you gave Google 15 headlines, let's say the second result in this page, center windows,even though central windows gave Google ten, maybe 10 or 15 different headlines.Google's picking two of those headlines to run in this ad.And we'll see.There are different ways to control and sculpt what information Google shows.So let's talk about the anatomy of a responsive search ad and what is included inside one single responsivesearch ad unit.You have 15 headlines, up to 15 headlines, five different descriptions, 90 characters each.Options to add imagery, a final URL.The final URL is where all of the traffic that clicks that ad, any combination of that ad is goingto wind up.Display path.The display path is the URL that will be shown on the ad.So sometimes your URL is a little bit long or a little bit ugly.It might be forward slash something forward slash collection right.So the display path is just you could say w-w-w dot your site.com/evening gowns.Right.Like you could just you could clean up the URL just for visibility for aesthetic perspective, yourbusiness name, your business logo.Those will appear on certain placements on YouTube and display and of course, your extensions.Remember that ad level extensions, the extensions that you add in a responsive search ad are goingto override campaign and account level extensions.So you have your site link extensions, your call out extensions, your promotion extension, call extensions,location extensions, app extensions, lead form extensions and structured snippet extensions.And we're going to talk about all of those individual extensions in more detail.So at the top of this graphic, right, we have all of our ad assets, the headlines, the descriptions,the image options, your URL, Google's machine learning at the time of auction for every individualsearch, Google is going to be looking at all of the available assets within a responsive search ad.It's not as if you give Google, and then they predetermine, we're going to only use this to thesetwo headlines, or we like this description the best for all searches that will come from here on out.Every single time there's a search, Google is going to look at all of your available ad assets andcreate a possibly new combination.So time of the search takes place and Google forms the best ad for the best user.So it might be headline three and headline one and headline six with image three next to it, your URLand description one and description three.That's an example combination of what your ad might actually look like once it is served on the page.Now remember your final URL is just one URL per responsive search ad.So in this example we have adventure ppc.com/contact.That means any time this ad appears, any times headlines, descriptions, images from this responsivesearch ad appears on a Google search results page and that ad gets clicked.It's going to go to this page.However, the final URL doesn't have to match what the display path is.So for the display path, just to clean it up, I might want to say adventure PPC, dot com, forwardslash Google ads, forward slash agency.And you don't need to be worried about keyword stuffing your display path.Sometimes people make go through a lot of effort to make sure the keywords are inside the display path.You don't need to worry.You don't need to be worried about that.It's not impacting your quality score, and it's not really going to impact your click through rate.But if you are taking the time to optimize your display path, the landing page path should align withthe content of the user's query.So if somebody's searching for agencies or this is an ad group that focuses on blue bicycles, or it'san ad group that focuses on mother of the bride dresses, then try to have your display path indicatethat the page you're going to land on is going to have information that's relevant and aligned withthat original query.Writing headlines for responsive search ads is a really frustrating and can be difficult process fora couple of reasons.One is you just have like 15 headlines.Um, and it's a lot of writing to do.Two, you have this little annoying blue meter that Google now displays at the top of your responsivesearch ad creation process, and it goes from poor to good to to excellent.It's really evaluating using AI.The strength of your ad.But don't make yourself crazy about this blue meter.If you have it, if it's good or if it's poor, Google's not going to stunt your search impression shareor your volume, and that score can often change quickly once some real time data is coming in.But here are some of my favorite, um, sort of rules tricks of the trade to follow.When you're creating your headlines for your responsive search ads, use all of the available headlineand description fields.Google is giving you 15 headlines.They're giving you five descriptions.Use them.You now have ChatGPT.You have a lot of different AI models.If you're not able to sit or you don't have the time or the creativity yet to sit and write out allof these different ads, just use generative AI to do it.Even within Google, Google is going to give you ideas that you could literally click and then, um,insert as a headline.Number two, focus on diversity in headlines.This is really important.Google likes it when you when they see different words, different messages, different ideas in headlines.So don't just repeat the same headline ten times with one different word.So this is an example.If you're advertising an agency, we have premier Google partner, PPC, advertising agency, awardwinning agency, pay per click management request, a proposal.These are all different ideas that produce variety right distinctly and uniquely.Add some personality to your headlines and don't worry.Don't be afraid to test and to really try to, let's say, communicate your brand voice.Utilize strong calls to action.Right?So your headline headlines can say contact us now, shop our annual sale.Check out our our our unrivaled selection.Um, download the number one best selling guide.Right.So you could really use these, uh, stronger, more, more proactive calls to action in your headlines.Highlight your unique selling points.This is an obvious one, but think about what makes you different than your competitor and try to writethose messages into your ads.What's tough is you only have 30 characters, including spaces and special characters, in a Googlead responsive search headline, so it's going to be tough to get all 30, um, to get all 30 or to touse or to get a message across in just 30 characters.But with creativity and with using ChatGPT for help, you could you could get there.Very important to align with landing page content.So think about the whole structure here.Right?We have an ad group.That ad group is going to have thematically related keyword group keyword keyword lists.So if I'm selling fountain pens it's going to have a thematically related group of fountain pen searches.If I'm selling women's dresses, it's going to have a thematically related group of dresses.Maybe it's an ad group for floral dresses, or it's a an ad group for sequin dresses.My headlines should talk to the keywords and the themes of that ad group, in addition to the uniqueselling propositions and any calls to action.And I should make sure that it all relates to the content and the information on the landing page thatthis ad is going to be sending people to.Incorporate numbers and statistics.Right.We talked about ad copy creative headlines.Try to avoid unsubstantiated superlatives like you're the best at this.You have the most of that.You're the most whatever.Use statistics.So don't say we're a company that has lots that has lots of customers.Say we're a company with a 97% satisfaction rate.And lastly, leverage dynamic keyword insertion.We're going to talk about what dynamic keyword insertion is.But it's a great trick that Google uses to allow ads to be more relevant and hyper personalized.To insert dynamic keyword insertion, you enter a brace signal, the little squiggly brackets in thead group in the ad headline space when you're creating in the in the ad creation box.So you have those little squiggly brackets and that's going to pull in the keyword from the account.So now the question is which keyword specifically is it going to pull in.But if you once you enter the the squiggly bracket, you're going to get a guided method that Google'sgoing to allow you to to use a countdown timer, a location insertion, or a keyword insertion.When we're talking about dynamic keyword insertion, let's say, you know, here's a good example,right?So you might have you might have an ad group for plumbers in a location, plumbers in Toronto, plumbersin Vancouver, plumbers in a certain zip code.Right.So you might have a list of 50 keywords that begin with plumbers in and then common searches for zipcodes, city names, state names, whatever it may be.And you might say, okay, let's, let's let's have one of our headlines in a responsive search ad reservedfor that exact search.So if somebody searches for plumbers in Vancouver and that's the keyword that that search query triggersthat, that, that that search query activates.Dynamic keyword insertion will pull that keyword from your account into the headline.Keep in mind spacing and capitalization.You can add words before and after the squiggly brackets.So you could say looking for and then squiggly bracket keyword.And then after the keyword colon will be your fallback in case the keyword in the account extends wouldextend that headline past 30 characters, or for whatever reason, for for whatever other reason itmight not be eligible.When you're creating your your squiggly brackets, you're going to say keyword colon.And then there will be a then there will be a space for you to enter a fallback keyword that Googlewill use for that headline in case they cannot pull in the actual keyword or phrase from your ad group.And lastly, dynamic keyword insertion is not available for Pmax campaigns.I want to talk to you about pinning headlines.So pinning headlines is a method that forces Google to use a certain headline in the top one, 2 or3 positions.So when you go into pin a headline, you'll see a little bit of a grayed out pin thumbtack icon.And when you click that icon, you're going to get the option to pin this headline and you're goingto get an option for different choose choose different positions.So Google recommends choose show in any unpinned position.So Google will say for this headline, I could show it in any position that hasn't already been pinned.That's basically saying to Google, rotate and put this put this headline wherever you would like.Or if I have a headline that I really want to show first, I say show only in position one.That means if I write a certain headline, let's say it's a, um, Warby Parker official site, andI want that to be shown on every single competitor ad and every single, um, every single branded searchad.So I'll say Warby Parker official site will be pinned.It could only be shown in position one, or I could choose to only show a headline in position two,or I could choose to pin a headline and only show it in position three.So a few a few highlights.Um, and things to think about when you're pinning headlines.Number one leverage pinning sparingly.We've tested pinned headlines and non pinned headlines and we find that Google likes it.Google's machine learning likes it when headlines are not pinned.Highlight key features key benefits.So if you're going to pin a headline make sure your headlines one, two and three are really, reallyimportant.And the best things you have to say about the products and the services in that ad group.You could adjust pins to highlight seasonal promotions, discounts, special offers if you're running,if you're running a limited time sale, if you have a limited time offer, if there's some sort of seasonalprogram going on, pin Pinned that message in the first, second or third spot.That way, you know it's always going to show up.Combine pins with dynamic keyword insertion to ensure that your ads are highly relevant to the searchquery.So if I'm going to pin, let's say an official site in Warby Parker, official site in position one,maybe position two will be pinned.Dynamic keyword insertion.Therefore, I know that my ads are going to be relevant to what the user searched.You can use location specific pins to tailor your ads to different geographic regions.So let's say I have an ad group that really is focusing on a a 24 over seven locksmith or a servicethat that relies on being local.So it could be any local business, it could be products that are shipped faster in certain locations.So then you might say always showing in position two same day service in Atlanta, Georgia, as an example.Use pins to address common customer objections or concerns.So just as an example, say Um, you're you have some sort of guarantee that's unique in the industry,or you have a really favorable return policy.Free returns.Right.So maybe you would say same day shipping free returns as a second position pin, if that's somethingthat really talks to a pain point in the industry.Look at your competitors.This is generally good advice.Look at do competitive research.Look at what other agencies look at, what other companies that you compete with are doing, and thenfigure out something to say that's unique and appealing.Implement that into your business practice.And now you have a really great second or third position pin.Lastly, regularly review the performance of your pins to identify which ones are driving the best resultsand adjust accordingly.Let's go into a a Google Ads dashboard and let's create a responsive search ad together.So here we are back in this search campaign.We're going to go into this campaign.We're going to click into an ad group.Let's say we click into This ad group right here I go to over navigate over to ads and I'm going toclick the big Blue Plus.And I'm going to click Responsive Search AD.That is the ad that we want to create right here.Okay.So this is the ad creation dialog for responsive search ads.On the right hand side we have our preview.We can toggle between desktop preview and mobile preview.We could cycle through different placements on mobile and how different ads might look with differentad extensions.And I could do the same cycling with desktop.So go back going back to mobile on the top in this blue bar we're going to have different suggestionsfrom Google.Google wants us to add more headlines, include more popular keywords in your headlines, make yourheadlines more unique, make your descriptions more unique.And it says that we've done three out of the four things, but yet our ad strength is still poor.Go figure.This is a very hard and frustrating bar to figure out, and I tend to ignore it.Okay, so the first thing we're going to do is our final URL, let's say the Xbox.com.I'm going to go and just make sure that that URL is working.And as you can see, this is the home page and great headline.Add screens to any laptop in a snap.Shop the Xbox Snap.And this is the website, the landing page that we're going to send traffic to.So in this example we're choosing we're going to choose to send people to the home page.Now if we wanted to to to for example, write an ad for the Xbox snap this specific product, we can.And if I scroll down this go scroll down through this site and I say, okay, how are we looking here?Great solid page.All the information is there.We're not going to do a full we're not going to right now do a full overview of um landing page design.But there's a built in price option right down there.So I'm going to go here and say, you know what.Let's let's send let's send this to, let's send traffic for this responsive search ads to this page,so I'll copy it.I'm going to go back to Google and I'll paste this final URL right here.But this is a pretty messy URL right.Forward slash pages forward forward slash snap story.So I'm going to say the display path.What people will actually see will be the xbox.com um, let's say snap sale.Okay.So now you see right over here, the Xbox.com forward slash snap sale is the display path.Even though that that's not the actual URL people will be going to.Okay.So Google will often pre-fill headlines for us.So as you scroll down here headlines, it says that we have 11 out of 15 connected.So right away I see that this is a really bad one.It just says Zebec.All right.So it's not using up all the space.If I hover I'm going to um, get options.But look, none of these are really great.But here how about meet the new Xbox snap?That's not bad.Um.Try screen workstation.Um, okay.Also not bad.Free yourself.That's bad because it doesn't mean anything.Um, how about work from three screens anywhere?Okay, so that's sort of expressing a little bit of what it is.Free shipping and free returns.Number one, best selling mobile workstation can be too long.Uh, mobile.Uh multi screen.I like this.Instantly add two screens 15 second setup.So this I could just sort of.I don't like it.I could take it out.Um increased productivity by 44%.That's interesting.I can paste it in there.Um, portable laptop workstation.That's an interesting one.Take that one out.Dual or tri screen?Your pick.Okay.We could go.We could.We could test a headline like that.And if I had, you know, if I was going to go through this whole process, I'd write another five headlines.But let's just stay over here.Now, do I want to pin?So if it's the meet the new Xbox Snap and maybe it's trademarked, uh, maybe I want to pin this.I hover over pin and I can show only in position one.Okay.So now as I go through my my.If I go through my my variations, I'm always going to see Meet the new Xbox Snap as the first headlinebecause I pinned it.And now you're seeing, um, you're seeing all the other headlines could rotate.So dual or tri screen your pick.Um, meet the Xbox snap free shipping and free returns.Meet the new Xbox snap instantly add two to screens.Okay, so Google is going to be able to rotate into different, um, into different options.As I scroll down here I have descriptions.Four out of four descriptions have been written.I see the character counts are pretty decent.The design is centered around simplicity and portability.So that's clearly just like sort of a silly AI generated, um.Um, generated description.And you could rework them if I hover over if I hover over here and delete it, Google will give me someother options.Elevate your work routine with Xbox, Xbox snaps, quick setup and modular design by now.Okay, so you can rework these descriptions.I'm not going to go into detail on rewriting all the descriptions right now, but this is your areawhere you're going to have your descriptions show up.Below it are your images.If you click edit, you'll be able to choose from images that you've already uploaded, or you'll beable to upload your own images.Business name we could enter.In the business name, we have a business logo, um, and then site links.So site links are the most important extensions.If I go to account level site links, this is an indication that that this responsive search ad is goingto pull account level site links.So I can click on the account level site link site links to get a a top level view of the of the sitelinks that will be applied.And then I can also click edit and I could, I could pull in individual site links that I want for anyof these responsive search ads that I create.So for example um educational discount, I could click edit and I could say, okay, so the educationaldiscount on a desktop I might get um, more text.I have a description line one.So, um, um, save on all Zebec products.And then second line is when you show proof of enrollment, something like that.Okay.And then I have sitelink URL options.I could I could add a final URL suffix, a tracking template, if I want to do additional tracking parametersfor clicks on individual site links, I can also schedule a site link.Especially this is useful if there's a sale.If there's a promotion running, I could say I only want this site link to show between certain daysor between certain times.If I wanted to create a new site link, I would just create over here.I would write in the site link, headline text and then optional descriptions lines line one and linetwo.A final URL and site links are really good.Um, site links are the best type of ad extension.Why?Because it adds the most amount of actual physical real estate to the screen when you have a site link,text and descriptions, but also it gives customers more options to go to direct pages.It's almost like a mini navigation right inside the ad.Now we have if you click on more asset types, you have all of your other ad extensions.Consider an ad extension like an accessory.It's like an add on.It's like jewelry for your ad.These are all these different little tweaks and perks that you can adorn your ads with to take up morespace and to offer more relevant information.So promotions if you click Add Promotion, if you're running a promotion, you could choose a sale that'shappening and a sale a promotion extension might not look or appear so different than a site link extensionor a call out extension, but Google will look at promotion extensions, and if they feel that the useris looking or shopping for a promotion.And again, this is these are the signals that Google has access to.Google is going to be more likely to run a promotion extension.You have price extension.So if you have a range of products or services, you can actually add those products and those prices.So if I click over here, there's one already been built and I can click edit, I choose my my languagecurrency.If there's a price qualifier like from or up to or on average, and I have a headline, a price, Icould choose if it's units in per hour per day, maybe it's a rental rate on a hotel room, maybe it'sa rental rate on sports equipment, whatever it may be.It might be service fees per month.You have a final URL, and then you have additional sitelink extensions that you can add, and you couldchange the order of them.So you have a keyboard over here, keyboard, mouse, power bank.These are all additional items that this website sells.And if these Sitelink extensions appear by if these price extensions appear below the search, add belowthe description, they will be clickable.So somebody could click.So it I my.This is my second most favorite um extension price extension.I think that like in the world of Google search advertising, we're not talking about big brand.We're not talking about big brand advertising.We're talking about sort of like brass tacks sales.That's the world of performance paper.Pay per click advertising.So price extensions allow you to bring price into an ad immediately, either appealing to customersor avoiding a click that's not going to lead to a sale.So one of the most powerful forms of one of the most powerful components of Google Shopping resultsis that you have an image and you have a price, and you only pay Google when you get clicks.So if you're clearly establishing to a customer that either you're too expensive or you're too cheap,or you're just not in the ballpark for whatever reason, you're likely going to avoid that click, andthen you're not going to have to pay Google for a click that was not going to convert.So price extensions for service businesses, for other products, for categories, um, for hotels,for digital goods inside responsive search ads are a very powerful way to make a responsive search adsearch ad almost behave masquerading like a shopping ad.So I'm a big proponent of adding as many price extensions as possible.If you want people on mobile to be able to click your headline and dial you directly from the ad bycircumventing a landing page, that's when you would add a call extension, um, a call out extension.These are just sort of like your high level selling points.So if you if you hover over here, you'll see account level call outs, integrated kickstand, no messycables, no magnets needed.These are your like little taglines.And you could go into your call out extensions.You could deselect any for this ad group or select them all.Or you could click new Call out and just create a new call out extension.So these would be for additional call outs for additional text that would that would come in this callout.And again you could schedule call out extensions as well.Structured snippet extensions Again similar to Sitelink extensions.These are extensions that look at the hierarchy of of your website.And if I go to create if I go to create I would select the header type.And these are predetermined rubrics or categories of products or of let's say information that can bearranged in a hierarchy.So for example featured hotel I might have my 1 to 4 most featured properties that I'm trying to promote.I might offer a number of different degree programs.I might be offering housing services or tours in a certain neighborhood.So those structured snippet extensions are structured.Snippet is just another way of saying there's a hierarchy.So I have a top level category.And then I'm going to have um, my unique attributes or my unique values nested inside.What is a a typical or popular category.And you have you have to choose from Google's list of categories.So oftentimes structured snippet is not relevant for your campaign.But if it if you do fit into any of these um categories, then I would highly recommend creating structuredsnippet extensions.Lead form extensions is a really interesting form of of ad extension where you could actually collectinformation, collect a form, fill from somebody without them having to go to your website.And if you go into creating the form, you would have a headline your business name, a description,you can request certain contact information.And what's nice about it is that it's pre-filled.So Google knows my name and I could choose first name and last name.Phone number could be pre-filled, email could be pre-filled.This is a really great form of lead gen directly within Google Ads search results.You could customize your submission message, your your submission message, and you can also look athow you could preview how, um, your form.Your form extensions.Your lead form extensions are going to perform.We're going to look inside of Google Ads.This is a mobile preview.Here's a desktop preview.I click on the ad, I would click Learn More and then it would pop up on Google without loading my site.This form that I configure here and I could request company information.I could add custom qualifying questions.I could add a link to a privacy policy URL, I could have a background image for the form and I couldcraft my my form submission thank you message.And I could also select the call to action for your ad whether it's contact us apply now, so on andso forth.There's a lot of different customizations.You could really build out a proper form right here inside the Responsive search Ads experience.If you're a service business, I strongly suggest you explore with lead form extensions.Finally, you have locations, extensions, a list of locations that you service, if applicable, andapp extensions if you have a companion app.If you're maybe you're running a responsive search ads campaign to a website, but you also have anapp available for download.You can activate an app extension.Once you're done.You would save the ad and the ad would go into review.So there's a lot of stuff here.Just creating one responsive search ad.But the highlights.The most important things to think about is is your landing page correct for the keywords in the adgroup?Are your headlines unique, distinctive?And are you leveraging headline pinning correctly?And do you have good descriptions, strong descriptions that that that create a clear call to action?Describe your value proposition.Describe what makes you you unique in a research centric, objective way that that's factual.Um, and do you have at least sitelink extensions and price extensions and that's, that's that's everything.That's that's your whole responsive search ad.It's going to take some time getting used to.Once you're done you would click save ad I'm going to click cancel over here Then the ad would be going.It would go into into review.Google usually reviews those ads within a couple of hours.It might take a day.Don't worry about your ad strength column.Um, it's it's not something that needs to be worried about.It's something that's there as a general guide.And if an ad is struggling in particular and you're just, you know, that there should be more impressions,you know that your click through rate can be could be higher just from maybe from historic from historicexperience.Then you can go in and try to optimize specifically for your ad strength score, but especially whenyou're creating a new RSA from scratch, responsive search ad from scratch.I would not be overly concerned with the ad strength score.So that's RSA in a nutshell.We've we've walked through the anatomy of an RSA.We've built one together inside an account.Um, but let's in the next lecture talk about some of the pitfalls and difficulties and challenges whenrunning RSA responsive search responsive search ads.And I will see you shortly in the very next lecture.
