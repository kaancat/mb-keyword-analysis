# 20.27 Keyword Planning- Using Google Keyword Planner to Get Volume & Cost Estimates

How do Google ads fans and welcome back.Before we go into Excel and get too deep into keyword organization and things like that, I want totake a pause and go back into the Google keyword planner because the first time we went there, we weretalking about getting keyword ideas, but it's also a really useful tool for getting traffic and costestimates, building out a plan, getting actually conversion estimates, which is a new thing, a newtool that Google recently released in the Google keyword planner.And it's really useful to know your way around the Google keyword planner, this part of the keywordplanner.So let's go back into Google ads.So here we are in our dashboard.We have our office chairs campaign, but pretend that we're continuing to build out the office sharecampaign.And I'm doing this you're following along with me step by step, building out a campaign for popping.It's not a real client, but this could be done for any single company.So the point of this course overall, just to take a step back, is to give you theory, is to giveyou concepts.It's for you to understand the proper process, the proper technique, the fundamental theories of managingand creating profitable Google ads accounts.That's the whole purpose.So throughout the course, setting up the settings, you guys, we've all sort of followed along stepby step.That's been great.Now we're getting into the part where I'm teaching you lots of different things that are available,and you're now supposed to apply that knowledge to your specific business.So it could be, you know, researching some rush and getting some estimates, getting some ideas throughUber suggests or some other tool is sufficient.It could be that doing it all in the Google Keyword Planner works, it could be doing this manuallyinside the live UI works for you depending on the size of your business, your budget, the amount ofproducts, the amount of services, your conversion goals, what you're trying to get out of the campaigns,the value it all is going to impact the proper procedure for you to follow.So I wanted to point that out because I'm not going to go through the Google keyword planner for everysingle type of business that would take an enormous amount of time.It would be a waste of your time because if I'm doing a good job as an instructor, then you're comingaway with the proper concepts that you could then apply in the right in your right context or situation.So here we are back in the campaign and say we're continuing to build out this office chairs campaign.So office chairs, desk chairs, computer chairs, ergonomic chairs, etc..We're trying to get you know, we're trying to figure out the proper structure of the proper biddingstrategies that we want to start off with.So I'm going to click again for go to if you don't do that click escape and go to tools.And again, the keyword planner and presented with two options.So the first one we did was find new keywords and a few lectures back.But now we're going to get search volumes and forecasts.So we'll click this and we can do a couple of things.We can either upload a file of keywords or we can paste in keywords or type in keywords separated bycomma.So we're going to type in some keywords, office chairs.Desk.Desk Chairs.White office chairs.Ergonomic office chairs.Swivel chairs.That was a new one we found.And that's enough.I'm going to go ahead and click Get Started.And you can always come back and edit this later on.So as you remember from the first time we looked at the screen, we could change the location setting.So let's say I want to switch back from New York to the entire United States.I'm going to remove New York.I'm going to type in the United States and choose the country.So I get a most accurate assessment of my keyboard volume.And we could also change language and the search network, Google and Google search partners and keepthose as is.So here we have an overview.Google is telling me that I can get 49,000 clicks for these keywords that are right down below herefor 76,000 and a $2 max CPC.And we could change these things around right over here.You're taking you're looking at an output of the keywords that we typed in.And one of the distinctive differences between what we're doing here and what we did in SEM, Russia'sSMERSH, was spitting out a list of ideas based on the original keywords we gave Google.Even the Google keyword planner when we got keyword ideas was spitting out a whole list of potentialideas.This is like, okay, these are the specific keywords we want to have in our ad groups.Let's get some estimates.Let's see where what we're doing here.So right away, I could I could sort by clicks, I could see, okay, what is the keyword that I'm likelyto get the most clicks for?Well, office chairs.Office chairs seems to be the most broad.Google's suggesting that I can get 27,000 clicks a month, 542,000 impressions for a click through rateof 4.9% and an average CPC of a dollar 55.Now this is all based on a mac CPC bid of $2 for that keyword, but I can edit that.I can go in and say, hey, maybe what would happen if I made my Mac CPC bid $4 and I click save.Well Google then tells me I'm going to get more clicks, a lot more impressions, not much higher ofa CTR, more spend on that keyword in a higher CPC.Let's say I put that to $0.30 and I click Save.So Google actually reset that 37 bit to $2 because it was too little.They're not going to give me estimates based on that.Maybe if I try a dollar and I click Save.And I have fewer clicks, actually a higher CTR in Google's estimates, although that's likely to nothappen in the real world, and 85 cent CPC and much, much lower cost.So you can play around with these things again, don't assume that this is exactly what's going to happenonce the key is alive in your account.It's that's it's unlikely that things will line up exactly this way.So I usually don't mess around with with changing the bids too much here.I don't think it makes that much of a difference.And I just realized I made a little bit of a mistake.You guys probably caught the mistake a couple of seconds ago.I did.When I changed those bits of $0.30, they actually just got got brought down to the bottom of the list.I thought that Google just was going to give us estimates, but it looks like they do.So if I have an office chair bid at $0.30, Google's predicting here you go, much fewer clicks withwheelchairs at $0.30.You know, the impressions, obviously minuscule cost over the course of a month.Don't worry about CTR, it's inaccurate.And 25% clicks.Now, this doesn't even mean that you could get 30 cent clicks.It's very possible that if I put a bid at $0.30 for office chairs.I would get no clicks and no impressions.And I might get a warning sign inside Google ads that says your bid is too low to to be on the firstpage or something like that.It might happen.It might not.But again, it's fun to play around and get an idea.And if your client is asking you for these different estimates, you could certainly tell him or tellhim or her in the beginning and saying or the team you're working with saying, hey, like Google ispredicting that if our bid was $0.30, these would be the results.Google is predicting that if our bid was a dollar 50, these would be the results of this quote overthe course of a month with these locations and these different settings and things like that.So that's definitely something worth looking into and worth thinking about.There's a really cool thing here with Conversion Metrics, which is a new feature.So if I click on Add Conversion Metrics, I could actually predict what my conversion rate and returnon ad spend will be based on some predefined values.So conversion rate, Google doesn't know your conversion rate for these keywords, obviously, becausethey're not keywords that are active.It's not a live account.But say, you know, your conversion rate, if you know your previous conversion rate, then go aheadand enter that in give take an average.Again, these are just ballpark estimates.If you've never run a campaign before, if you're e-commerce, do something like one 1 to 1.5%.If you're a lead gen and you're getting training form submits to something like four and one half tosix and a half percent to be conservative, we have Legion campaigns running at a 25% conversion rate.We have ecommerce campaigns running at a 5% conversion rate.But again, go ahead with the estimates.So say we'll do 2% and our value per conversion value per conversion can be whatever you want it tobe.It could it could include all your costs.So it could be like a total profit.It could be a gross revenue, or it could be like your average checkout value, your average order value.So say Poppins, average order value is probably something around 350 bucks.So we'll go ahead and click Save.And now Google could actually tell you the total conversions you're going to have for your budget.So Google's estimated that I'll get 80 conversions at an average CPM, $46, 28,000 worth of revenue.Because you take that $380, you take that $340, multiply it by 80, you get 28 K for a row as of 7.6,which is a return of ad spend.So for every dollar spent on advertising, I'm going to earn back $7.60 in advertising cost.So if my if my cost is over the course of the month, it's 3.7 thousand and I earn 28,000 in revenue.That's $7.60.For every dollar spent on advertising brought back in.Now that.Does that mean you're profitable?Well, I don't know.So if you were just giving a total revenue.When you when you entered in those conversion values, then you have no I have no idea if you're profitablebecause you need to know your actual margins.Are you earning $35 in profit on a $350 order?Are you earning $200 in profit on a $350 order that goes into talking about ROI?And we'll talk about calculating ROI and calculating ROI in the in a section where we talk about formulasbut say you wanted to get a sense of your profitability so you could simply go ahead and edit this 350to not, to not reflect your total checkout value, but instead to reflect what your profit is.So say I know that my profit margins are 40% so I can take three, which basically in English is sayingfor every $350 in advertising or for every dollar I make $0.40, $0.40 of that is profit.So I would say so.So you do $350, multiply by 40%.That's $140, right?So I say $150 is my value per conversion.And you can put that in and I click Save.All right, so now my rise is three times.So for every dollar I'm going to earn, every dollar spent on advertising, I'm going to earn $2 backin profit.And you can make these estimates.And again, you can send these estimates to clients.You can look at them for yourself.It's very, very, very helpful.If you expand this, you could you could take a look at different metrics on how your max CPC wouldaffect overall conversions.So that's the default.So if I say OC at a $5 Mac CPC, I'm going to get more conversions.I'm going to get an average 110 conversions a month instead of 80 conversions a month.If I want to take a look at average CPA, I can say OC my Mac CPC.How will my Mac CPC affect average CPA?My cost per acquisition.My cost per conversion.If I look at cost of the overall cost of the campaigns, I could say, All right, how will my Mac CPC,will bidding more or less affect how much I ultimately spend?And again, to go back to what I always talk about a profitability, the most important thing to predictand try to predict is profitability.So take a look at conversions and conversion value, but most importantly, return on ad spend.That's where you want to be.You want to be maximizing your return on and spend nine times out of ten.So in this graph we actually see as our cost per click increases, our return ad spend goes down.So there's a sweet spot between the right amount of profit and also the right amount of value.So you could lower your bid, right?You could have a bit of a dollar or $0.50 or $0.30 and have a higher return on ad spend.But you're going to have much fewer conversions.You're going to ultimately generate less dollars in profit.So there's going to be a sweet spot of you're willing to cut into your return on that spend.You're willing to take a little bit less of a profit margin if you could get more profit, if you couldultimately walk away with more money in the bank account, that's the most important metric.How much money am I actually generating?Now in this case, we're looking at one, two, three, four, five individual keywords.We could upload a whole list of keywords and we get much more sophisticated estimates.But this is a really good place to get these traffic and cost estimates.And I would say that these are more accurate predictions than you're going to get in.Sam Rush I could head over to the negative keyword section and I could add negative keywords to my campaign.So let's say I wanted to add negative keywords like Free Amazon.Walmart, let's say, and click Save.Now these negative keywords have been adding to my plan, and I could also click on historical metricsto take a look at over time the search trends broken down by mobile and desktop for the keywords thatare that.I've uploaded it into this list so I can take a look at locations and get a locations report.If I break it down, we sort of went through this briefly in a previous lecture.I can look at my ad groups.Back in my ad groups is this one ad group.I can edit the name of the ad group, say, I want to call this office chairs.And I'm going to call this test because we already have one in the campaign.I can go up into my plan overview.And say, okay, here's my plan overview.These are the predictions for the keywords that I have.These are the locations that I'm targeting where we expect to see 2000.On on mobile phones of cost, 3000 clicks, 49,000 impressions, fewer on tablets, a little bit, stillless on mobile phones in the yellow, but but less but on desktop, rather.But less than mobile phones.More than tablets.Tablets.The smallest amount of impressions, cost and clicks, you know, really, really awesome.I could download this report into Excel, but what's really neat is that can actually go ahead and createthis campaign.So I went ahead and clicked Create Campaign.I could make a new campaign.Let's call this planner campaign.I give it.I could either set my own budget or give it the recommended budget.I usually like to set my own budget.So that's I want to do $50 a day and click Save.Really simple, really easy.So, like, we could really build the whole thing.Congratulation.Your new campaign is almost ready and I can go ahead and create apps for the campaign or start a newplan in Google Keyword Planner.So I click start a new plan.It brings me back to where I could either be finding new ideas or get search volume and forecast andgo out and build a campaign.If I want to go into my account to make sure that campaign import it properly, I click the back arrowand here we see now in the left hand side of planner campaign with this ad group that I just named,with the keywords that I have in it, with the bids, and that's something which is really cool.So the bids that I were that I was working on inside Google Keyword Planner were inherited by this newcampaign.They import it properly.So I have a dollar here, $0.30 and then $2 worth of default, the ones I haven't changed at all.So it's really, really neat.I can go into my planner campaign settings and now I can go ahead and manage this campaign from scratch.So you could use the planner campaign to build out full campaigns with groups.But the one thing that we don't have is ad copy.So if we look at ads, there's no ads.We'd have to go and create our ads manually and we're going to work on building out this account manuallyas we go along.Last thing about the Google keyword planner, I typically don't use it to build campaigns.I typically don't use it.I don't recommend you guys using the Google keyword planner to really build out a complete campaignin ad groups structure and then import it back into AdWords.I like to go I like to go through things methodically.I like to make sure I'm setting up all my campaign settings properly.So I don't miss anything.I like to write ad copies as I'm going along.I like to manage my keywords really outside of AdWords in most cases to get my keyword list and keywordideas.But what I do use Google Keyword Planner for what I recommend you using the Google keyword planner foris getting those forecasts, getting those trends, looking at the competition, getting new keywordideas, seeing.But, but what I think is one of the most valuable things are, is putting in that conversion rate andyour value per conversion, a daily budget, a max CPC and getting these estimates, seeing gettinga sense of, oh, if I spend this amount and this is my profit per conversion, this is how many conversionsI'm likely to get and this is the profit I'm likely to earn in the revenue I'm likely to earn, thevalue I'm likely to generate from those campaigns at this level of spend at these at these bids.And I think it's a really, really neat predictive tool.It's really fun to work with and clients tend to see a ton of value in it.So that's awesome.I'm going to go ahead actually and pause this campaign.So I'm going to go into all campaigns campaigns up here.I'm just going to pause this planner campaign and I'm going to just look at my enabled campaigns becauseI don't want to run that that planner campaign.There's nothing going on for us there, and we'll take it from there.So that's a good overview of how to use the Google keyword planner, both for forecasting and for gettingkeyword research ideas.And I think now at this point you understand keywords, you understand match types, you understandthe dynamics of keywords, you understand negative keywords, and you also understand really how toresearch keywords in a really, really sophisticated way.You have a lot of tools at your disposal.Any company that brings you an account, I think you're really well suited to very, very professionallyresearched keywords.And part of that research is learning about the lingo of the business.There's going to be so many long tail keywords and just vocabulary that you might not be familiar withthat these tools like asking friends the Google auto suggest CRM, ask the Google keyword planner Ubersuggests Somerville asking people on the street your own intuition, writing down ideas that these toolswill uncover.You'll be so surprised and they'll be so impressive the types of negative keyword lists and positivekeyword lists that you'll be able to put together.In the next couple of lectures, we're going to talk about keyword organization, how to use Excel tostart conceptualizing our themes and really structuring out the full scope and size of what a good campaignshould look like.And again, this could be for ecommerce or for service businesses.So with that, I look forward to seeing you guys very, very soon in the very next lecture.
