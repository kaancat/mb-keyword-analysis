# 9.2 High-Quality Conversion Data

Welcome back to key Pillar.Number three leveraging machine learning.Machine learning is all about getting high quality conversion data.Machine learning algorithms rely on conversion data.So if you don't have conversion data, none of your machine learning your smart bidding strategies aregoing to work.Smart campaigns learn how to optimize bids for each auction with conversion history from all of thecampaigns in your account.Keep that in mind.It's not just the campaign.It's not just that one campaign that you're analyzing all the conversion data across all the campaignsin your account help Google build a paradigm, a foundation for which they're going to be able to betteroptimize real time bids.When a user clicks on a branded ad and converts it into a lead, for example, all of the signals fromthat user are fed back into the algorithm.And in fact, that's a really good case to be made for branded advertising.And those signals will include gender browsing history, whether or not the user is on a specific audienceor remarketing list.But the same thing happens when a user clicks on an ad and doesn't convert.The system is always improving to meet goals, so if a user clicks and doesn't convert.Google's starting to learn.Okay, what are the characteristics of a non converter?When Google sees a conversion they're starting to understand what are the common denominators.What are those similar characteristics amongst all these people who are converting.And in the the chart on the left in the graphic on the left, we see that there might have been four,eight, 13 conversions from these three smaller campaigns, and there might be a much more importantcampaign.Generic search.Google is learning the types of people who convert using that data, even from smaller campaigns, tooptimize the bids in this more generic search campaign in real time.
