# 22.4 Understanding Ad Rank and How It Is Calculated

Welcome back to the society section.Well we're going to start talking about how to calculate ad rank and your actual CPC.You now understand qualities or you understand the auction and now we're going to really dive into themodern day Google Adwords auction where we understand what number your average is higher ad Reinke determinesyour place in the auction.And more importantly how the actual auction works to determine what you pay when your ad gets clickedon.So we now know the history of quality score.Why it was implemented.And we also know all the factors that make up quality score.But the question still remains who cares who cares how good or bad your quality scores are in the previousslide.We spoke about inflated costs with low quality scores and now we're going to really dive into what exactlythat means and how it works.It all begins with an understanding of how ad revenue is calculated in the post Quality Score era likewe saw a while back in our example with Brad Ben and Brett.The old formula used to calculate ad ranke didn't account for quality score essentially the highestbidder.When the top slot since Max CBC bid was the most important factor in calculating ad rank.The new formula introduced to calculate adjuring changes things up dramatically.So let's see what that new formula is and what it means for advertisers and their bidding wars.The new formula for adverts that Google introduced in 2005 was outdrink equals Max CPC bid times qualityscore.The formula stayed that way until 2013 when Google introduced the expected impact of ad extensions onCD-R as part of the adjuring formula.Google found that different sorts of ad extensions like cyclings call outs review extensions etc. couldfavorably impact an ad CD-R and they included these ad extension CD-R projections into the add ringformula.But we don't know exactly how the addling formula change in order to accommodate the ADD extension factors.Brad Getty's of certified knowledge proposes that add extensions account for about 20 percent of thequality score portion of the current adjuring formula.But whether or not that number is precisely accurate we can be very confident that it's not much morethan that because so many advertisers are using out extensions and because it's a pretty small factorby itself we'll continue by evaluating some examples scenarios with the primary formula which is atranke equals Max CPC bid times quality score.Let's create a sample auction with some of our old friends but now add a couple of women into the auction.So in this example we're going to have Brad Beth Brett Ben and Brenda all bidding on the same keywordfor the sake of the example.Let's assume that there are only four available ad slots on this particular search results page.So only four of these five advertisers are going to win an ad spot at this auction.So let's say Brad says his Max CPC bid at $9.Beth sets hers at seven dollars.Brett is willing to pay no more than six twenty five Benz Max is three dollars and Brenda is the mostfrugal bidder at $2 for her Max CPC.Now let's make up some quality of course for these folks.Brad gets a quality score of one Deathlands a 3 but gets a perfectly respectable 7.Ben is mediocre with five and Brenta hits the jackpot with a 10 quality score.Now let's calculate the respective add rank so we can determine their position.Remember we get ad ranked by simply multiplying the max bid by quality score.So Brads add rank is a 9 Beths is a 21 Brets add rank is forty three point seventy five.Ben has an ad rank of 15.And finally Brenda with an add rank of 20.Now that we've calculated the add ring for each advertiser in the auction we could determine their positionson the search results page.Remember in our example here there are only four available at slots.So Bret wins the coveted top spot on the page even though there were two advertisers in the auctionwilling to pay more than him for a click.Since he was serving a higher quality ad he was able to take the first spot with his 7 quality score.Beth takes the second spot on the page beating other high quality ads like Ben and Brenda since shewas willing to pay substantially more for a click.Brenda who is willing to pay the least for a click win spot number three since she's serving such ahigh quality head and Ben win spot number four with his combination of bid and quality score.Interestingly Brad who was willing to pay a whopping $9 for a click gets snubbed altogether and doesn'tget any spot on the page because although his bid was the highest his quality score was so low thathis ad rank wound up being worse than everyone else's.This helps understand how crucial quality scores are even before getting into the formula for determiningactual cost per click which we'll get to in a moment.Let's think about it let's say Beth went to work on her qualis score by rewriting her ads and puttingtogether a more relevant landing page and she got her quality score up to a 7.Now instead of a 21 or outdrink would be a 49.And she would win the top spot from Bret without increasing her bit at all purely on the basis of improvingquality scores.She was able to change her position and if for example Brenda was to let her quality score slip froma 10 to five her ad rank would turn into a 10 and she'd lose her spot to Ben.So now we could really see how the new ad Rinck formula really puts a huge emphasis on quality scoreon a very practical level.We see how connected your opposition is to how Google perceives the quality of the ad you're offeringand the option but position isn't the only thing the quality score effects.We know that your max CPC bid isn't the actual price you pay for a click.It's simply the most you're willing to pay for a click quality score plays a huge role in how much youactually end up paying for a click.And as promised let's take a look at how your actual CPC is determined and what role qualities coreplays in that area of the auction.So I just reset the original numbers here and reordered the advertisers in order of ad rank.We've got Brettan spot number one Beth and spot number two.Brenda and third place back and forth.And Brad the loser knocked out of the running for this particular auction.Google says up there auction that an advertiser could bid the maximum they are willing to pay for aclick but they only have to actually pay the minimum amount needed to maintain their position or inother words the minimum they would need to beat the advertiser directly below them.From a mathematical perspective as explained by Google's chief economist Hal verion you have one.The price advertizer one has to pay with Q One that advertisers quality score and that's going to bejust enough to beat be won the bid of the advertiser below him and Q2.The quality score of the advertiser below him to solve this equation.You get P1 equals the add rank of the advertiser below him which is his bid multiplied by his qualityscore divided by the quality score of advertiser 1.In other words your actual costs per click is the ADD ring to be or the address of the advertiser rightbelow you divided by your quality score.So let's figure out what our guys and girls here would actually have to pay Google for an ad click tofigure out Brets actual CPC.We take 21 which is the ad Rinck of the advertiser with the ad ranked directly below him and we divideit by 7.So Brett's actual CPC is $3 Beths actual CPC is calculated by taking Brendon's ad rank and dividingby three which is best quality score and that gives us an actual CPC of six dollars and 66 cents.And the same thing goes for Brenda and Ben giving us an actual CPC of a dollar fifty for Brenda anda dollar 80 for Bret.Let's just say for example there were five ad slots available and only these five advertisers in theauction.Then Brad wouldn't deal with the fifth spot.But since there isn't any adjuring below him he'd have to pay a minimum clicked price determined byGoogle.But let's take a look here and we could see some really interesting things.The first thing you probably noticed is that the number one spot in the page isn't paying the most fora click.Paying just three dollars for a click and position one which is more than half the click price Bethhas to pay to remain in position to.And that's purely because of Bret's higher quality score.We see a similar thing down below with Brenda and Ben but just with less disparity between the actualspecies.So we see what a huge role your key word love a quality score actually plays in determining how muchyou end up paying for an ad click.Now let's take a look at this a little further.Say Beth improves her quality score and she turns her three into a six.So now her rank is a 42.She's still in position to on the results page because her average is still lower than Bretts.But look what happens to her actual CPC now and we divide 20 which is the ring to beat by six.Her quality score.We get an actual CPC three dollars and 33 cents.Half of what she was paying before.So by increasing her quality score by a few points she's able to drastically lower her actual CPC.Now let's take a look at Brenda.Brenda can't increase her quality score any more than a 10.So is she paying the absolute minimum possible to maintain her position number three.Well yes and no.In this example she's paying the lowest possible CPC to maintain position three.But theoretically at Ben's quality score was a four instead of a five which would make his add on to12.Brenda would then only have to pay a dollar 20 per click and this highlights the mechanics of the auctionthe quality of the ads being served by the competitors in any given auction makes a really big differencein the actual CPC.You have to pay like we just saw with Brenda and Ben the worst Ben's quality score is the cheaper Brenda'sclicks become.Since Brenda only has to pay the minimum to keep her at spot over Ben.Now what if Brenda wants to do better.What could she do.She already has a 10 quality score and can't improve that anymore.But what she could do is though is raise her Max CPC bid.So say she raises her Max CPC bid to $4 she doubles it.Now what happens.Her address jumps up to 40 but she's still in position three.She still pays a dollar twenty a click even though she doubled her bid because of dollar twenty is stillall she needs in order to be bent.But did anything else happen to any of the other appetisers.Yes Beth could no longer just pay $3 and 33 cents to beat Brenda.Now if we divide Brenda's new add rink which is 40 by Beth's quali score which is 6 Beths actual CPCjumps way back up to six dollars and sixty six cents.Pretty amazing.If Beth raises her Max CPC bid to $5 instead of four she'd have an average of 50 and automatically takethe top spot.An actual species of all the other advertisers would have to be calculated again from the top.Of course we can never know the ad ranks of the advertisers below us or above us so we never actuallyknow what anybody else's actual CPC is or are going to be.The important thing is to appreciate the influence of quality score on actual click prices and to beacutely aware of our quality scores when assessing the health of your account and the costs you're payingfor clicks the better your quality score is the cheaper your clicks are going to be.We're drawing close to the end of this first chapter in our quest to better quality scores but there'sa few more important things I wanted to cover to those of you who've made it this far.You guys are real troopers and I hope it's been at least a little helpful and not a total waste yourtime.
