# 15.2 Guide to our Google Ads Audit Process

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about a simple guide to running an actual audit of a new account.Number one, open up the website.So many people start off by digging into the account, looking at keywords and ads and bids.Start off by looking at the client's website.Look at the navigation.See all the different pages, the products that are offered, the contact page, the checkout process.Run a run, a couple test conversions.Look at the different categories of services and products.Get a sense of the home page, what information is there, and when you spend time on the website,you're going to begin developing a little bit of an idea of the audience, the price point.Look at some competitors, do some Google searches.Really, I would say spend a good hour on the website, competitors websites and just looking at someGoogle Trends, some sample Google searches, and you begin getting a feel, a little bit of a courtsense for what this business is about.Number two, open up the account, the Google Ads account.Do a quick check on conversion tracking and what's actually being tracked, because if conversions aren'tbeing tracked or conversions are being tracked completely inaccurately, and you see that no recordedconversions in the conversion section, then everything else you see is going to be reasonably useless.Make sure to understand.Don't just don't just rely on convert on the conversions column segment by conversion action.What conversions are being tracked?Sometimes we'll go into an account and we'll see tons of conversions.And it's like every landing page view is being tracked as a conversion.Every click is being tracked as a conversion.Um, you want to make sure you understand when you see the conversions column, what actual actionsare being considered conversions.And that will give you a good sense of what the campaign's goals are or if there are no goals set.Are there multiple actions being tracked?What are the primary or secondary goals?What is the setup of the conversion action and where are the conversion actions firing.And then you go to the Web pages tab inside your conversions menu.Are they firing on thank you pages.Are they button clicks?Get a sense of how this tracking has been, has been configured and what actions are actually beingtracked.That will also give you a sense if the first thing you need to do is to set up conversion tracking,or to diagnose conversion tracking.Number three, once you confirm that nothing crazy is happening or they're not missing conversion trackingentirely, go through the account.If there are multiple conversion actions being optimized for, check if the campaigns are optimizingfor each one individually.So if the account has multiple conversion actions, make sure that the campaigns themselves are optimizingfor the correct conversion actions.If so, if there are multiple actions being tracked, filter campaigns to only include campaigns thatare optimizing for one conversion.If not, if all the campaigns are optimizing for one primary conversion, you're good to now to lookat the account as a whole.So the first thing we do is research website, getting a feel and then looking at the quality of data.And that's going to be primarily through conversion tracking.Next look at time lag.That's going to give you a good understanding of recent data.How many conversions come in right away.How many conversions come in after ten days.After five days.Um, that's going to give you a sense of how conservative and how aggressive the account is, and it'llhelp you decide what type of strategic approach do you want to take for this account long term?Number five, set that date range to all time and look for any key trends and spend CPC conversion rate.Start to develop hypotheses of what happened.If there are major fluctuations, you go to all time in that overview chart.You're going to see maybe it's five years back or ten years back.You could even look at 2 or 3 years back.And that that's going to give you a snapshot of trends.Did CPCs did your costs per click dramatically rise in the summer of 2019?Did you see a huge drop in conversion volume in Q1 of 2022?Um, did you see a big swing in conversion rates fluctuating rapidly during a certain period?Right.So that's going to you'll either develop hypotheses why these things happen, or you're going to writethem down as questions to look into further, because understanding the historic patterns of an accountis crucial for being able to understand the current last 30 day data and what you project for the future.Repeat step number five for each campaign type for each filter you created.So you're going to be looking at display campaigns and maybe looking at pmax campaigns.You might be looking at search campaigns.You might be looking at, um, shopping campaigns.And you want to get that historic snapshot for each one of those campaigns that's going to start.It's going to either give you good questions to write down to address later, or it's going to giveyou the ability to develop some hypotheses for what the behavioral patterns over the course of a year,through the seasons, through the quarters, are for a certain account.Then switch to a shorter time frame, 30 to 90 days depending on the account, depending on how muchspend and data there is, and see if there are any significant period over period changes during thistime frame.So you could go to 30 to 90 days.You could add your compare window and say, I'm going to compare the last 30 days with the 30 days beforethat.We're going to compare the last 30 days to the same period last year and then see, are there any majorfluctuations in performance.And again, you're going to either have some good questions.Either you'll see things are flat or stable.You might see major fluctuations.You're going to be developing theories hypotheses and so on.Number eight the search terms report really important.Sort your search terms report by the highest impressions, spend and conversions.It could either be sorted by clicks, impressions, spend, conversions.It doesn't really matter, but what we want to see is what search terms are driving people to your site.Search terms are what the are, what users actually typed into Google that triggered your keywords.The search terms report is a great way to understand some quick wins and identify if there's any wastedspend.Repeat step eight for audiences for your audiences tab for your placements tab products device landingpages.Look at the search terms report and get a sense of whether or not you need to develop a better negativekeyword strategy.Or maybe the account is too conservative and you're seeing just tons and tons of brand search.I remember once, um, we signed one of our largest clients four years ago.They're still a client today, and they wanted me to do this whole audit.And we typically do a really sophisticated audit process.I quickly looked at the account.I got a feel for the website.I went into their search terms report, and I saw that 98% of their search, 98% of their budget, wasbeing spent on branded search.And I sent them an email saying, look, I'm not doing an audit.It's not worth it because there's not enough here.You guys have been spending for years riding on the coattails of your existing demand, and you've donenothing to attempt to capture more demand.And of course, you can't scale because all you're doing is branded search.Um, if you want to work with us, sure.We're going to help you develop a new strategy to capture more spend.I'm telling you that your results are going to go.Your results are going to decrease in the short term because you're getting a great Roas on brandedsearch, but we're going to be building out a more sustainable, long term approach that's going toallow you to really grow your business, and your results and your Roas are going to drop dramatically.And we sign the account.I didn't have to do an audit.So that's the search term report really important.Number ten look at all the ads.Open up the ads report.Don't segment by ad group or campaign.First.Just go to all campaigns and then go straight to that ad tab on the left hand vertical navigation.And sort your ads by top spending ads or ads that have received the most clicks or conversions.And look at the ads.Are they written well?Right.That's a great place to do an audit.You're going to be able to spend a lot of time in looking at sitelink extensions, looking at the qualityof the responsive search ads, looking at the headlines, the descriptions, structured snippet extensions,call extensions, really do a full range diagnosis of ads and write down the most important things thatyou're seeing.Next, look at the bid strategies and targets versus actuals.So get a sense of is this account bidding with manual CPC bidding or are they using target CPA targetRoas maximize conversions.And if they have target return on ad spend targets like a 200% 400% return or a target CPA, um, uh,target CPA figure in the account.So you could have target CPA as a bidding strategy.And then maybe that campaign is targeting a CPA of $75.Look at the target versus look at the actual CPA in the account.Is the CPA lower higher just about the same.That's going to give you a sense of where the opportunities might lie for a strategic approach to optimizations.And then number 12, this can be followed by a best practice checklist, an n-gram analysis and specifickeyword campaign ad checks, all of which we talk about in more detail.We talk about n-gram analysis.And we're going to talk about the best practice Checklist coming up soon.So this is the the the 12 steps that are going to.Really cover most of what you want to cover in a quick audit to get a sense of what directions you mightgo with in an account.This this list of 12 covers some things with quick wins, elements of optimizations, and elements ofa strategic audit.Um, and the key things are again, really getting a feel for the business conversion tracking searchterm report.Those are the that's the three tentpoles that make up the holy grail of an audit.And then you're going to look at, um, you're going to look at ads, keyword structure, historicalpatterns, and that's going to flesh you out and, and give you a starting point for what is happeningin this account and where the opportunities might lie.In the next lecture, we are going to go through a best practices cheat sheet that will very much helpyou, um, deliver and develop these audits with more proficiency over time.Um, I will see you there shortly.
