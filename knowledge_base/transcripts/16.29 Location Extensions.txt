# 16.29 Location Extensions

How do you glass fans?And welcome back.Let's take a look at location extensions, as you can see from this image here.We have a couple location extensions in a search for AdWords agency.This is an actual old picture.This is not our address anymore that you're seeing between below our ad and the format is a little bitdifferent.But what our location extension is good for, great for local businesses, right?Brick and mortar awareness is important.So if you have one location or multiple locations, you could actually get these multiple locationsshowing up in your ads.It lends legitimacy, right?Even if you're even if you're trying to generate online sales, having an actual physical location lendsa lot of legitimacy to your brand.And you can also make people aware that you have locations that they might not have been aware of.You need to have a Google my business account to have location extensions, and that's going to be linkedto AdWords.If it's if your account is under the same email address and it's really easy, you'll be able to linkit by default.It'll be linked by default.And if you have a client account, ask them to give you either access to the Google my business accountor if the client has a Google my business account and it's associated with the ad, the Google ads accountyou're managing on the client's behalf, it'll be linked by default.They're also in your my client center.And we'll talk about my client center for agencies way down later in the course.Part of your location extensions will include business hours, reviews.You've gotten directions, whether or not you're open and closed.And if you're a brick and mortar store that's tracking results with Google my business, whether ornot it's busy at certain times, things like that, and that might get included in a Google locationextension.And again, you don't have the control over what elements are included.Either you're running a location extension or you're not.If you don't specifically add a location extension.This is pretty interesting.Google is going to most likely automate that extension.Google will show a linked address associated with a business account, even if you don't specificallygo ahead and add Google location extensions.But you could disable them.You could opt out of location extensions if you'd like.A pro tip is that you could use filters at the campaign level based on your targeting settings of thecampaign.So if I'm specifically targeting a certain area, let's say we're dealing with a client of ours downin Miami that has a number of of high level showrooms for furniture.We might only want to show a specific location in a specific campaign.And I'm going to show you that you could you could select which locations you want to show for any givencampaign or ad group.So that's pretty cool.So let's jump back into Google ads and take a look at what it looks like to set up a location extension.So here we are back in in Google ads.I'm going to twirl down location extensions.And I have the option to create location extensions.I could either find a Google my business account if I'm not associated, I could enter the domain nameand then I can send a link request.Or I could link to an account.I know Google will take my email address associated with that and it will see if it finds any locations.This is a burner account.I don't have any actual addresses associated with this account.I could request access to another Google my business account.So if you have a client then you need to request access to link the accounts.You could enter in the email address associated with that Google my business account and send that accessrequest.So it's not much I can show you in this account, but I'm going to jump into a live Google account wehave for our business.So you can take a look at what this looks like.So I'm under a campaign of ours under ads and extensions, and I'm going to add a new location extension.So if I want to add these are ads and I go to extensions and these are extensions and I can add an extensionand I'm going to choose to add a location extension.This is how you go and add location extensions.Once you have an active campaign already, I can either add this to a campaign or an ad group.I'm going to choose to add it to a campaign so I could by default, Google will sync all locations,but I could also click to options down specific locations I pick.So this is our current address.But if I had multiple addresses associated with my Google, my business account, I could say for thiscampaign only show this specific address as a Google extension, as a location extension, or I couldselect two out of three or however many I want and I could clear them all and click cancel.And that will give me a lot of customizability with regards to how I want my location extensions toperform.Remember that location extensions will run automatically unless you specifically opt out, and I don'treally think you should opt out.I think by and large it's really good if you do have brick and mortar locations and that's a locationthat's been verified by Google.When you set up your Google my business account, you have to get the postcard in the mail.You enter in the pin code.I don't see any reason why you wouldn't have that attached to an ad.Google shows location extensions a lot to me based on my experience.I'm not.This is anecdotal.It's not actually documented or statistically tested, but I think it's the location that they are mostfavorable.It's the ad extension that they are most favorable towards.So use them if you do have brick and mortar locations.So that wraps up our conversation about location extensions.In the next lecture, we'll talk briefly about promotion extension and how to use them.I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of seconds and the very next lecture.
