# 6.1 Understanding the User - The Right Messaging

Welcome back.Let's talk about reaching the right user with the right messaging.Now, to succeed with Google Ads, your messaging and your visuals should match where the user is intheir buying journey.We mentioned this before, but it's worth repeating.Use good copywriting and creative strategies to connect with users at each step of the funnel.So now let's talk about understanding that user funnel in a little bit more detail than we did previously.So the top of the funnel this is the largest part of the audience.These are the strangers you want to raise awareness.We want to let people know what you do, who you are, that you exist, that this is a product or servicethat could be beneficial.This is when you want to talk about those emotional payoffs.You want to talk about why the lifestyle benefits, the social benefits, the economic benefits of yoursolution, of your products, of your services, the middle of the funnel.This is where people are like, okay, I'm aware that this solution exists.I'm maybe not.I might not totally I might not be totally bought into it, but I am interested in learning more.Right.These are people who are researching long blog posts about cars.They're researching detailed information about mortgages.They're researching about diamonds, they're looking into products more deeply and materials, etc.they haven't committed, but they're interested.That's where we want to drive consideration.We want to start talking about features.We want to start talking about what differentiates us from the competition.We want to talk, talking about the specific quality, what makes us as a brand unique.And then bottom of the funnel is to generate conversions.It's talking about people who are ready to buy.People who are actively seeking that solution.So you want to talk about your promotions.You want to talk about the ease of doing business with you.You want to talk about the security, the trust, the validity that you have as a brand.And these are principles that apply equally to lead gen businesses and e-commerce businesses.So the key idea here is that there's three there's there's many more stages.And the stage of the funnel is not only is not always linear.Sometimes people go from a prospect back into being a stranger who who is out of market.And they go right back into market and they skip back into, into, um, ready to becoming a customer.However, the key thing to remember is that everybody travels through these stages for every singlepurchase.And sometimes if you're scrolling, you know, one time I was scrolling Instagram recently and I sawthis ad for a weird origami like lap computer desk, and I clicked the button, swiped up, purchasedit.I went through the whole buyer's funnel from not even being aware that something like that existed toconsidering it, to being interested in it, um, to deciding to buy it, to actually purchasing itin a span of 30s.Sometimes, um, a buyer's funnel could take 15 years, but we all go through those stages.So it's important to understand the stages and to understand that the emphasis of our messaging hasto be different depending on the stage.Um, so let's let's go through an example here, the top of the funnel awareness.Right.So somebody is looking for um, somebody who's going to ultimately wind up looking for a solution forback pain.Feels the pain in his back and might be thinking why does my back hurt right?That's informational.And now the goal.If you're a mattress company, if you're Casper Mattress, um, the goal is to make you aware of a potentialsolution structure.So.Oh, back pain.It might be your bed.Okay, so we're not talking about Casper's specific foam technology or a July 4th promo, right?It's the messaging has to be I want to I want to make you aware that this is a potential solution.So interest is like, okay, well, now now I've been made aware that my bed might actually impact myback pain.Now here's something that a lot of brands mistake.And this is something which is why humility comes into play.A lot of brands think they have to continue to hit on the nose.Um, awareness to a solution as if customers don't know it and they're usually wrong.Usually.Especially when we're dealing with Google meta sort of performance advertising.Most of the time people understand and they're aware of the core solutions out there.You're unlikely if you're in a market or a product that's so completely unique that it's never beforebeen seen.Um, that's something else.But in this example, you probably don't have to spend so much time and money explaining to somebodythat a better mattress could alleviate back pain, or that a really poor mattress might be the causeof back pain.Nevertheless, you might have a really good piece of content on your site.The research is in five key associations between back pain and mattresses that are too soft, right?So that might be a great piece of content to re reiterate and reaffirm in the user's mind that my mattressreally might be a cause of my back pain.So now maybe this prospect is interested and they're searching Google for best beds for back pain.Um, so now you want to position yourself not necessarily as somebody who could explain that this isa solution, but you begin position yourself that you might be the best possible solution.So you might have content on your site.The best five beds for back pain, the best five mattresses for lumbar support, the best five mattressesfor sciatic pain.And of course, you would softly and subtly promote your brand as being the best possible, best possiblesolution.And you would substantiate with real data and real facts why that might be the case.So now that person is interested.Now we're talking about somebody in the funnel who's actually looking for solutions, assuming thata specific solution is what he wants he or she wants to explore.So best beds for back pain is indicating that I already believe, and I'm already aware that a bed ora mattress can moderate back pain.And now I'm looking for the best solution.Now they've done some research, they're more aware and they're interested and they're more, let'ssay, knowledgeable of the market.And now they're going to Google and they're searching for Casper versus purple.Now is your time.You're at the bottom of the funnel.At the bottom of the funnel.Somebody is expressing intent.They're expressing knowledge.They're expressing that they understand the industry a little bit.Now, your job is to stop talking about how beds in general could moderate back pain.Your job is to talk specifically about you versus the competition.Why should I buy from you today?What makes you special?What are the features of your product?And this is another big mistake I see advertisers making.Oftentimes I hear this refrain right.Don't talk about the features.Talk about the benefits.And it's a classic example from sales training.Nobody buys a vacuum because they really want a vacuum.They buy a vacuum because they want a clean room.So talk about the benefits of a clean room.That's one of the most misguided and misused quotes of all time in advertising.Okay, let's just break it down for a second.Nobody buys a vacuum because they want a vacuum.Great.That's true.They buy a vacuum because they want a clean room.Nobody buys a hammer because they want a hammer.They buy a hammer because they want the nail to go into the wooden board.Great.Okay, so talk about the benefits of having this box put together.Talk about the benefits of having a clean room.Sure.If this is the first time someone's buying a vacuum.So if you're not aware and you don't know that a vacuum gets a room clean, and you're not aware thata hammer could could push a nail into a wooden board, then yeah, it would.It would be worthwhile to talk about.Wow, look at the benefits of a clean room.Look how great you're going to feel when you don't have to sweep the rug.You could vacuum the rug.But to continue to talk about the benefits of a clean room in a market where everybody understands thebenefits of a clean room is is is totally misguided.It just doesn't make any sense.Nobody needs to hear that anymore.Everybody knows what the benefit of a clean room is.In fact, anybody searching for a vacuum today is going to be making their purchase decision.Not what, not what, considering whether or not they want a clean room or they want a more efficientclean room because everybody has a vacuum cleaner now it's all going to be feature based.So this idea about don't talk about the features, it's not true.You should absolutely talk about the features.And I would say nine times out of ten with nine products, out of ten products that I see, you shouldalmost exclusively be talking about the features, because somebody who's going to Google searchingfor why does my back hurt?Yes, that might be an example where you could show them information that correlates back pain, um,back pain and, and mattresses, but no one's going to Google and saying and saying, um, why is myroom not swept?It's like, well, you didn't vacuum it, but if somebody's going to to Google and searching for, um.Best vacuums or, um, best home.Even something that's less specific.Like like best best buys for the home.2024 2025 whatever.Then, even if they're not specifically identifying that they're looking for, um, a Dyson versus amealy vacuum, you should still talk about the features of the vacuum.So all that's to say continue to emphasize features, but especially once somebody is expressing thatthey're looking for this.And oftentimes in Google they're expressing they're expressing that search intent.Um, and they're searching for Casper versus purple or best beds for back pain.Um, you want to start talking about why somebody should buy from you today?What makes you different than the competition and why should they should trust you?So keep in mind here's here's another important thing to remember.The number one fear that consumers have is that you're not safe, that you're going to fleece me, thatI can't trust you, that you're a sham.Everybody has this defense mechanism every time they buy something.This is one of the reasons why Amazon is so successful, why it's so hard for brands to develop a verystrong presence off of Amazon, because Amazon has trust.When I buy from Amazon, I know it's going to arrive, and if it doesn't arrive or it arrives broken,I know I'm going to get a refund.It's not more complicated than that.People trust Amazon, and when you're buying something from an unknown manufacturer or brand, whetheror not this is a safe transaction is my number one fear.So you have to do as good of a job as possible at at instilling trust with reviews, testimonials,validity.The badges guarantees that's your job as an advertiser.Not to start.You don't need to like.People will only be interested in even understanding the features that your product has.Once they trust that you're legitimate.And trust could come in many different ways.You don't necessarily have to have testimonials, a website that's polished with professional photographyand with good usability, and it just gives the impression of of high quality production that couldthat could instill an immediate sense of trust.That's enough to earn the customer'sattention, to learn about all the different features of your product and the best advertising.The best brand experiences are experiences that give a sense of brand, but very practical, featurerich messaging in one, I would say Sonos is an example recently that I think does a phenomenal jobat this.When you go to the Sonos Com website, automatically you get the idea of elegance brand high quality,premium feel.You just it comes in the web design and the copy exudes it.Yet at the same time, they're extremely feature rich.They're not spending most of their time just talking about, oh, like, think about how amazing itwould be to have a speaker to listen to music without a pair of headphones.Like, they don't say that because they don't need to talk about the benefits they get, the benefitsthey they show through premium materials and through premium web design and through premium communicationsthat we're a premium product.And then they talk a lot about the features, about the technology, about the surround sound, aboutthe bass drivers, about the decibel levels, so on and so forth.Very much feature rich information.So I can make an informed decision comparing the specs with one product versus another.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about the BJ Fogg behavioral model.And it's one of the things I really like talking about.I think it helps us understand how to approach messaging.And I will see you there shortly.
