# 8.2 Supply - Demand = Competitiveness

Welcome back.Let's talk about supply and demand and how that relates to competitiveness.So supply over demand equals competitive competitiveness set in other words the sum of competitors impressionshare multiply multiplied by by the competitors top of page rate divided by industry search volume.This metric is a relative metric to gain insight into how competitive a market is in Google.So the impression share remember is what percentage is that?What how saturated how saturated is a specific competitor.So if a competitor has a 95% impression share, that means they're showing up there.They're showing up for 95% of all the available impressions.Multiply that by their top of page rate.So that's that's a that's a metric or that's a that's a benchmark of aggressiveness.And if you divide that by industry search volume, by how many impressions there are available, thatwill give you a relative metric compared to other competitors and to other competitive page rates,that will give you a relevant relative metric to gain insight into how competitive a market is.On Google, this is a really cool metric to build.You can build this as a custom column in Google, and again it will give you a a quick gut check tohow competitive a specific market is.Let's talk about the three main components to the supply of an auction.Number one is how many competitors are bidding on a certain search term or a certain collection of searchterms.Number two, how often those competitors are winning auctions.That's search impressions.Share, like we just said, and how often they appear at the top of the search engine results page.That's top of page rate.That's that's a that's a that's a benchmark for aggressiveness.So if competitors place the top of the page, 20% of the time, the auction dynamics are very differentthan if a competitor's ads placed at the top of the page.80% of the time.So if a competitor is at the top of the page, 20% of the time, it's a more aggressive and more saturatedmarket.So when you multiply these three variables, that will give you a sense of supply.When we want to know, can we get into this market that will give us a sense of how competitive or howmuch, how aggressive of an investment, how aggressive we have to be in our bidding to really enterand make a splash in this market.So if we have the number of competitors, multiply by average search impression share, multiply byaverage top of page rate as supply.That's going to give you a sense of wait.Are there a lot of is there a lot I could capture here?Another way of saying the number of competitors multiplied by the average search impression share isthe sum of competitors impression share.So that those two, those two ways of calculating it would ultimately give you the same sort of thesame notion.Now that's supply.Right.So that gives you a sense of of of what?Supply is available.Now what about demand.That's where we talk about total amount of available impressions.That's search volume.So if there's an increase in search volume for a keyword let's say pet insurance for example, and thesupply stays consistent, the competitiveness of the market decreases.Right.So if there's an increase in volume there's an increase in demand.And now the amount of supply stays the same.Or the amount of people offering solutions stays the same, the industry becomes less competitive becausethere's more demand to go around.Search volume is taken from Google's internal data and is rated on a scale of 1 to 100.You're going to actually be able to see search volume inside Google Ads.So the competitiveness metric is a relative metric which we commend, which we recommend looking atovertime.So that's going to be a metric that you'll be able to find inside your Google Ads dashboard, the competitivenessmetric.And it will give you a really good holistic sense of of how competitive certain auctions and certainmarkets, how they how it changes over time.Typically, competitiveness increases dramatically from October to November holiday season and has beenand has generally been increasing over the last year.That's this chart that shows a general increase from the start of the year in competitiveness.And you typically see CPCs rising when competition rises as well.It's not always a perfect they don't always move in perfect harmony.But when competition goes up, when there's more advertisers bidding on the same or fewer availablesearches and people get more aggressive, um, CPCs will rise as well.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about troubleshooting high costs.
