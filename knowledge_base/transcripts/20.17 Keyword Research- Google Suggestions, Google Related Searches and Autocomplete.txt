# 20.17 Keyword Research- Google Suggestions, Google Related Searches and Autocomplete

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.Let's dive into keyword research.We talked about some keyword research techniques for negative keywords.So it's very similar and we're going to run through them quickly here, but it's worthwhile coveringthem nonetheless.All right.So there's a few different keyword research tools that are really good to use.If you remember from a bunch of lectures ago, we discussed it, but you have Google suggestions.This is going to be like autocomplete.And related searches autocomplete.Swvl.And Uber suggest.Which is now a tool owned by Neil Patel.And when you take a look at that, friends and family, co-workers asking them to search for the productsand services we spoke about, that we don't need to go about that in more detail.And then there's going to be the keyword planner.And I'm going to show you in the next lecture more detail about the keyword planner and how you canuse it for finding keyword research ideas.Keyword ideas.But let's go and take a look at a couple of these different items.So here we are back in our Google Ads dashboard.I'm going to click the Google Ads logo to bring me back home.I'm going to go to campaigns and I'm being och, I'm sort of building my office chairs campaign, butnow I'm going to go to building my desk campaign, let's say.Oh, just before I forget, there's one other thing that you should do is your website and your competitorswebsites.So say I'm going to build out my my campaign for desks and I want to get some keyword research ideasso I can go to Google and I can start searching for office desks and I see what drops down.So I see office desks for sales.A good one.I see that office desks near me is going to be a bad one.I see that.I see IKEA is going to be a bad one.Amazon is going to be a negative oh office desks for home.That might be good staples for sale near me.I don't know if that's going to be a good one.So I get some negative ideas and get some positive ideas.That's the Google autocomplete.And if we go to office tech and office desks and click Enter, we'll start seeing some ideas on theSearch Engine Results page.So if I scroll down and I look at the auto suggestions, I see some, oh, L-shaped desks.That's going to be a good keyword that I'm going to want to have in my campaign executive office desk.That's a great one.Modern office desks, that's another good keyword.Commercial desks.That's another good keyword idea.Computer desks, that's another good keyword idea.Home office furniture sets.That's probably not going to be an idea based on what we offer.That should be an ex executive office desks for home.I don't know if we sell that, but again, you get the idea.You literally go through a bunch of these different searches and you could also go and click L-shapedoffice desks, go through some of these, go back down to the bottom of the page and see, Oh, L-shapeddesk with Hutch.Do we sell that?That's another good keyword idea.You want to find these long tail keyword suggestions for positive keywords, then you start writingthem down.You copy and paste them into your account as you're building out this campaign.Before I forget, I want to just mention one of the thing is the Google ads suggestions.There's another place you can get some keyword idea ideas, and I'll show you that right now.All right.So that's autocomplete and Google related searches.That's a really good way of getting some ideas.Let's go back to Google and take a look at some of their suggestions internally.So say were to I want to build a new campaign yet but even if I were to go into office chairs and I'mgoing to go ahead and in my ad groups tab, create a new ad group and say, I'm going to do an ad groupchair with this one ad group for office chairs ergonomic.This is going to be all about ergonomic chairs.Now, on the right hand side of the screen over here, Google is going to potentially be giving us somead ideas.I'll put a default bid and it's loading.Maybe they haven't loaded up the ideas yet, but maybe I'll write in something like ergonomic.There we go.Now mic and hit enter.Make sure I have the right URL.And Google loads up some searches.So some of these will be irrelevant because I'm looking for office chairs and they're giving me somekeywords like desk and computer desk, computer chair, ergonomic chair.So I want that.So if I just click on it, it's going to add it and it adds as a broad match.Google by default would add as a broad match, and I could add ergonomic office chair.Ergonomic desk chair.So Google has some suggestions over here.If I click on Add all ideas, all the ideas in this window are going to show up as negatives.But let's say I see.Oh, what is ergonomics?If Google is giving me a suggested search with 3.6 thousand suggested monthly searches, I want to addthis as a negative.So I'm going to add in what is ergonomics versus a positive.And then I'm going to simply add a negative sign, a minus sign in front of it, and it will be addedas a negative when I click Save and Continue Office Ergonomics, that might be another negative.Ergonomic computer chair that's a positive.So office ergonomics might be a negative might be a positive.Let's say we would start that off as a negative.But remember, this is going to be added as a negative at a negative at the aggregate level.This should really be added to a negative keyword list.So if I were to select these, I could cut them out and I can go back into my negative keyword listfor my office chairs, campaigns and add them to my negative keyword list.That would be the right place to do that.Remember what we spoke about in the last lecture, keeping things really organized.And if I were to save and continue, I now have used some of those suggestions and Google's prompt meto create an ad, but let's go back without doing that.So that's that's how we get some ideas from Google internal suggestions.Google suggestions like autocomplete.Let's take a look at Uber suggests we already went to Super Bowl so you go back to Super Bowl and youcan find some good ideas there.But Uber suggests is a really cool tool.So if you just search for Uber suggest the first result will be the keyword tool.Neil Patel owns Uber suggests.Now Neil Patel is a great guy.We've done a lot of work with him and you start off by just entering a keyword.So let's say I want to write Enter in ergonomic chair because I'm getting ideas for my ergonomic chairgroup and I click search and you could select the country that that you're in.And we'll see some ideas potentially pop up.So first, we see monthly search volume 27,000 showing that it's high.It's showing that it's very highly it's a highly competitive search term.And that's just sort of going based on how many different ads they see being shown for these for thissearch term, for this keyword, economic share and an estimated cost per click.Forget about the estimated cost per click or these estimates because they're notoriously inaccurate.They're usually wrong.The point of this is just to get ideas for keywords so we could scroll down and we could see some keywordideas.Ergonomic chair and ergonomic chairs for office ergonomic chair, kneeling ergonomic chair, computer,ergonomic, ergonomic chair gaming.And then we could view all keyword ideas and we could continue to scroll down over here.And again, you just want to look through this, find ideas you could filter out by by search volume,how difficult it might be, how the estimated cost per click.And you can apply those filters and you could also export all this data into a CSV, which is goingto be really helpful because that's how you're going to start creating these thematically related groupsof keyword at scale.So you have ideas that you could then copy and paste back into your campaign.So any tool that allows you to export into a CSV format is really, really helpful.Ergonomic chair under $200.So some really cool stuff.And if I were to, I could I could copy and paste from here at the keyword to Cuba level or I couldexport into a CSV and copy and then copy in bulk back into my Google ads account.So if I was looking for a desk desk accessories, I would do the same thing.I continue to do lots of different lots of different forms of research desk accessories office for women,cute, cool gold.Rose gold.You're starting to see some ideas that you might not have originally thought of if you're just creatingyour campaign.So Uber suggesting that Patel's tools are really great, easy free tool to use in conjunction with Swvl.Both of those tools will give you a lot of really great positive keyword ideas.Remember, the research phase is not high level, tight organization.We're just trying to learn about how people are talking about our products, how our customers are searchingfor our products.We haven't begun to psychologically analyze with the type of search intent that's being shown of ofan individual keyword.That's the sort of process that we're going to go through when we talk about keyword planning and organization.Right now, we're just really getting a broad level sense of what's going on with the competitors aredoing and things like that.We should also take a look at our website and we should take a look at the website of our competitors.So if we were to go back to Poppin Dotcom.And we go into furniture.If we're looking for our desks and benching campagne, we could see adjustable height.How do people talk about it?Loft adjustable height L-shaped.I'm starting to see keywords.I would read through the details.I would read through the features.I'd say, Oh.See 47 inches to 23 inches for standing desks.So height adjustable up to 47 inches.Will, is that a search term or is that a keyword that has a lot of volume?If it is, if people care about that, then that's something that I want to potentially target.So looking at how your website is set up, looking through the descriptions and the features of theproducts and services on your website is a great way to start taking a look at potential keyword ideasfor yourself.Now we might take a look at a competitor site.So who are our competitors?Well, there's a lot of different ways you could tell who competitors are.One of the sites that I like to use to find competitors is called similar site or similar web, rather.And many of you are probably familiar with that service.You can just Google similar web and you'll find similar web and we could do a search.So analyze any website or app we're going to look for poppin dot com.I've never used the pro version of similar web.I think it's more for SEO professionals, but this is a really helpful tool it shows you.Global rank, country rank.Predicted amount of total visits they have.They have.They have pop in at 145,000 visits a month.85% of the traffic come from the United States.Referrals what sites refer to in.And we could go down here and just hit competitors and we could take a look at other sites that similarwebviews as competitors.And I could actually just click and go to that site.So here's Clevenger.I'm going to click Clevenger and I'm going to click this little button to go to Intercom.Here I am.And now I can start seeing how do they set up their site?Can I get some keyword ideas from lavender so I would navigate into their office chairs or office desk?Let's see.Desks?Or do they have chairs?Desk organizers.Let's look with oh sit to stand desks so height adjustable but sit to stand desk power desks, chairsand seating.I can go into chairs and seating.I can say stools.Okay.I wasn't didn't necessarily know to use stools.If I go into desks I might find some other ideas.Lift desk.So here's the word lift.I didn't necessarily know that that would have been a good keyword.And now that I'm checking out a competitor, I'm starting to get some of these ideas.Executive Electric Corner Desk, Corner desk.So maybe we have corner desks, maybe we don't.But just again, none of these one tools is sufficient enough.It's getting a comprehensive view of your products and services, but it's very important to rememberwe had that healthy respect.Healthy respect for the competition.Letting the competition or coming at building your campaigns, knowing that other people are doing thiswell and getting ideas from them, what what has what has their advertising footprint been?How can you sort of replicate some of the some of the success that they've been having?And when we get into keyword planning, which is sort of planning out how we want our our campaignsand our aggregates to look as we intend to scale out the campaign, that's where we're going to usetools like Sam Rush to see OC.Clevenger has all these different products, but what keywords in search terms is Lavender actuallyadvertising on?That's what we're going to talk about when we get into keyword planning.Right now we're again, we're doing research.We're just getting a sense of all the keywords.At a campaign level.You could use an Excel for that.You could use a notepad, you could use pen and paper because this is research.You don't want be too tight.You want to be you don't be too rigid.You want to be open to lots of different ideas.You're getting negative keyword ideas, positive keyword ideas, so on and so forth.So asking friends and family the Google Autocomplete Google related searches.Looking at Google's own suggestions when you're creating a new ad group, looking at your website,looking at competitors websites, these are all great ideas for finding ideas for positive keywords.Again, you'll maybe think of five or 10% of the potentially good keywords and spending some time onthis research phase and really investing and coming up with new ideas is really important, it's reallyuseful, and it will set the stage for successful keyword planning and keyword organization.In the next lecture, I want to walk you through the Google Keyword Planner Tool, which is a more robustinterface.It's the most accurate data because it comes from Google, you know, Uber suggests and Sam Rush andspy foo keyword spy, all these platforms, they just tap into Google's API and they siphon off thedata that Google gives, which is significantly less than Google releases themselves inside the GoogleKeyword Planner tool.And even what's in the Google keyword planner is significantly less than what's actually happening.But you'll get the most accurate snapshot from the Google keyword planner.Sam Rush, of course, does offer a bunch of these cool, competitive insights that Google Keyword Plannerdoes not.But when it comes to keyword research, I really think that the Google keyword planner itself is thebest tool that will give you the most potential positive keyword suggestions.And the nice thing about it is the Google keyword planner allows you to actually save specific ad structures,lists of keywords and sort of create these shells of campaigns and import them back into your accountin a pretty seamless environment.So in the next lecture, we'll check that out.I hope this was interesting and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
