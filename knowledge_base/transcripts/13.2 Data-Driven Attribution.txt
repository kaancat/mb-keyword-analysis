# 13.2 Data-Driven Attribution

So number one, data driven attribution.Let's explain that.What does that even mean?So data driven attribution is really a method of attributing credit for conversions with various touchpointsin a customer's journey based on their actual impact.So you have someone who searched for I don't know.Let's give an example of search for coffee mugs.Okay.So they searched for coffee mugs in the Google Ads search bar.They came across a Google search ad and they clicked on it.Then they, um, left maybe a couple and 30 minutes later after they're researching more stuff in the.What type of coffee mug they want.Maybe it's a heated coffee mug, right?One that keeps the coffee hot.So they're doing the research and they click on a shopping ad and then they find that your website'sawesome.They like the reviews.They're interested in the stuff.Um, and then they search for your name.So let's say, I don't know, I'm going to think of Ember mug.So, Ember.So you're going to be.So they're searching now.Ember mugs in the in the search bar.Then they click on what we would call a branded ad.Now the question becomes which touch point in the user's journey actually made an impact.Which campaign gets credit?Is it that original search campaign?Is it the shopping campaign?Which is more performance Max?Is it the, um, branded campaign?Now, what if they also got hit with YouTube, a YouTube ad for retargeting?They came on our site.We're retargeting to them about how awesome our mugs are.What if they also got hit with a YouTube ad?Where do we give credit to?What do we where do we attribute our credit?And also what how much credit do we give?So that's where data driven attribution comes into play.This is where machine learning algorithms and there's a lot of, um, math calculations.Um, a lot of stuff behind it that analyze patterns and trends in your accounts conversion data.So the model then assigns credit to each touch point based on how likely it was to contribute to a conversion.This could include clicks, impressions, interactions from different ads and campaigns.So right, let's say they just viewed the video ad but they didn't actually click.So that's going to be taken into consideration.Um, in the attribution model, um, the model continuously learns and updates based on new data, andit's always improving its accuracy over time.So the more data you have, the more it's able to recognize patterns of, yes, um, we're not goingto be giving all the credit to the branded search campaign because that that was that's where we wouldhave last click attribution.So look in the little box there you see data driven attributions in red.And then there's last click.So in the scenario we gave if we would choose last click that would mean 100% of the credit would goto Branded Search Campaign, which isn't the full story.And you're missing out on the data.And based on let's say that let's say you had 100 people go through that exact same journey, and thelast click was branded.And based on the data you're seeing in the account, you would say, or someone might say that thatsearch campaign we should turn off, it's not performing well.That shopping campaign is not performing well.We should turn it off.The YouTube campaign is not performing well.Let's turn it off.Our branded campaign is performing well.Let's increase budgets, which is 100% not true.Not the story.Because if you're just pushing branded, how are people finding out about your branded, about yourbrand and about your brand terms?So you have to be able to attribute, um, credit where credit's due.And that's where Google does that on the day.And the more data you have, the more patterns you can recognize across users.And it knows that.Huh.It seems like if we take out, you know, someone who didn't have that first touch point in search,their likelihood of actually converting is X percentage less.So we're not going to give as much credit to um, the the search campaign or the shopping campaign,whatever it is.So it'll say it'll try to, to put out these patterns and say, okay, we have a search campaign, ashopping campaign, a branded campaign.In this journey, we have a search campaign, um, a shopping campaign, a YouTube impression in this,and then a branded search campaign.In this second person's journey, we have a search campaign, shopping campaign.Um, when I say shopping, I mean performance.Max, um, and we have a YouTube campaign, um, and the branded.So you have the last two scenarios were the same, right?Okay.Now we have a without the search campaign.We just have shopping and branded.We have shopping YouTube and branded.What's the difference in percentage of conversion rate if that touch point actually was wasn't was there.Does it increase conversion rate by.What's the on a on a.broad spectrum, right?More data.The better, the more accurate it will be.More statistically significant.If we don't have YouTube as a touch point, does it make a difference?Is the conversion rate still the same amount or is it incrementally higher?Is it 5% higher that um, that touch point?So then let's give it more credit than what we were initially doing.And then it's constantly reworking its model based on the new data that's coming through.And that's where you're going to see, um, Google giving credit where credit is due.So maybe it'll say, okay, we have this one conversion.Um, and we're going to and there were three touch points.So we're going to give point 25% or 25% to, um, the search campaign, 50% to the shopping campaignthat seemed to make the biggest difference in the user's journey.And without it, there's there's a very low chance of converting.Um, and then the YouTube campaign will give um, 15%.And the branded search we give 10%.And then that's how it attributes the conversion and the credit.So you're going to be able to see when you're looking at the campaign data in the account, you'll beable to, um, actually look at more accurate modelled conversions based on the multiple touch pointsthat users have, because no, typically most users take multiple touch points to convert.So the question is what touch points?What helped push them over the edge?If this touch point wasn't here, would it have happened regardless?And you could answer that with more statistically significant data.So that's on data driven attribution.And every single conversion action has an attribution window and an attribution model associated withit.So if you see in this again in that box, you see data driven, you see last click.But they used to have first click linear time decay position based.Those are no longer available, but you could still see them in some other.I think in Google, Google analytics four.So first click is it's going to give full credit to the first click in the user's journey.Linear is giving equal credits to every single touch point.Um, time decay is less credit to one to touch points that were further away in the past, or furtherin the past.Um, position based will give around 40% to the first click, 40% to the last click, and equally distribute20% across all middle touch points.But nowadays, data driven attribution is the way to go.Last click.If you're on last click, turn it off.Please don't run it.Um, we do not want to be running that.And that's typically how, um, people used to run people.You could set up conversion tracking through Google ads directly, or you could set up conversion trackingthrough Google Analytics or Ga4, and then import that information to Google Ads.Now, in the olden days, back in the Stone age, um, people would would do that, would use GoogleAnalytics and import that conversion data to Google Ads.But the problem with that was that Google Analytics was on a last click attribution.So in Google Analytics, um, setup, if someone had a touch point with paid ads, with Google ads,had a touch point with organic, um, had a touch point with Facebook and then came direct, um, thedirect would get full credit and Google ads would never see that conversion.So then that, that, um, conversion being sent from Google Analytics to Google Ads would, wouldn'tbe sent, even though Google ads should take some credit for it.So, um, and the more data you have in Google Ads, the better the system will be able to learn.So you want to be able to to get as much conversion data as possible.Um, so that's where attribution is very big in the advertising world.It's very complex.There's different ways to go about it.But the question is, and what we want to focus on is attribution and conversion tracking in GoogleAds to get as much conversion data into the system as possible.So you're can teach these machines so it has data to work with.It has, um, you know, touch points and understanding about the users and the behaviors and the typesof person people they are and the, um, whatever it is has millions of data points on every user.The more data it could add into the system and help you and help, um, the machine bid on, um, newcustomers and get you more new customers because it has it knows which campaigns are performing well,which types of users are performing well.All of that information is fed back into the machine to optimize and help you perform well.Okay.Next we'll be talking through data conversion tracking.Um, point number two which is primary conversion tracking.So I will see you on the other side.
