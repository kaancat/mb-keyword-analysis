# 20.7 Keyword Match Types- Broad Match Modified

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture we're going to continue talking about keyword match types picking up with broad matchmodified.As you know, it uses the plus symbol to cut out related terms and synonyms.You're telling Google that these are the words that I absolutely require being in the search term beforeI'm letting you spend my money on showing an impression and potentially getting that click, you canstill generate a lot of bad clicks for irrelevant search firms and search queries.Don't think just because you have a broad match, modified keyword, or a campaign that has all broadmatch modified keywords that you no longer need, negative keywords you absolutely do broad match modifykeywords will still generate a ton of irrelevant traffic.Bromwich modified essentially says, as you know, queries must include all your modified terms, theones that have the plus sign.But you can, but not necessarily in that order.Not the search term could include the modified terms in a different order than you have them presentedin your keyword.And with additional terms before it and after it that are not modified terms that you're not necessarilytelling Google that have to be in my actual keyword.Again, negative keywords are still a must and they can be broad match.Modified keywords can be combined with broad match to only modify the most essential terms.And I'll show you what that looks like down below.So let's take a quick look at a couple of examples of broad match modified keywords and what the adsand what ads may show for.Over here we have leather desk chair and each of the terms is modified.So leather desk and chair all modified, which means, as you know, that in order for my ad to be eligibleto show the search term has to include all three of those modified terms.So pictures of chairs, pictures of chairs, desks and leather couches.All right.That's a search term that could potentially trigger that ad because leather desks and chair are included.Leather desk chairs for sale is another one because again, leather desk and chair is included, doesn'thave to be in that order.And it can include other additional terms.How about leather desk chair without the chair modified?So this is a combination of broad match and bar match modified.I'm telling Google that I'd like you to use Chair as a guiding point.I want you to know Chair is not irrelevant here.Even though Chair is not modified, you're still giving Google additional information.You're telling Google that this is all about chairs, so use that although the word chair doesn't haveto show up in the search term, it's an experiment.Leather desk chair, desk with leather inlays, desk chairs made of leather.These are examples search terms that could show up.I recommend experimenting with a search with with keywords that are partly modified and partly not modified.We did this with a big company that was an attraction company in Vegas, and we found the most successby using in Vegas, modifying the word Vegas or live for Las Vegas or Nevada and allowing the otherterms like what to do.Top ten attractions, fun things for kids to be more broad.And we got a lot of good ideas, but we wanted to make sure to modify Vegas because that was essential.Leather Desk Chair This is the most.Close to brawn match.I'm only telling Google that I want the word leather and I require the word leather in my search.And before I want an ad to be eligible to show and as may show on ads, may show on searches for leather,office accessories, office furniture and leather, leather leather blinds for corporate buildings,you know.Again, you have to realize that the broad parts of that keyword are still going to be treated as broadand Google could get pretty broad.You have to watch it using the search terms report, but the modified term always has to be there.Pros and cons of using broad match real quick.It's a great way to cast a large net to discover new ideas while controlling for totally irrelevantqueries.So it's as it sounds, it's a modified version of Broad.I'm able to still get a lot of good research ideas.I can still discover a lot of new ideas, but I'm able to, at the same time make my budget a littlebit more efficient by telling Google that here are the essential, essential things that I absolutelydo not want an ad impression for.If they do not, if the search firm does not contain it, improve CTR over broadband, of course, becauseI'm going to have less irrelevant traffic, cheaper CPC than phrase an exact match.It's a little bit typically more expensive than broad, but usually a little bit less expensive.Why?Why is it more expensive than broad?Because the terms that most competitors are modifying, the terms that you're going to be modifyingare terms that, you know, will most likely lead to a conversion.And as a result, those are search terms that are typically going to be more competitive.Some of the cons of broad match modified.I don't think this will get you out of negative keywords.You're still going to have, as I've shown you in some of these examples, you're still going to havea lot of irrelevant traffic.So you still have to really pay attention.That's not necessarily a downside.Negative keywords are great.It's part of managing a Google ads account effectively.If the order of your keywords is important, don't use broad match use phrase match.Because remember that broad match modify does not ensure that the modified terms show up in the orderas they appear in my keyword, Google could have them.The search term can have those modified terms in any order at any place.There's no there's no consecutive phrase that is being required in the search term.That's what phrase matches can be a challenge to generate a good click rate which can negatively impactyour quality score.A similar problem to potentially having with broad match.But again, don't be overly concerned.I don't really like spending too much time on the cons section of these keywords because I don't reallysee cons to any keyword match type.They all just have different characteristics.They're all different.They're all different for different use cases.So again, on the same note, if you have a research and development budget, if you're if your client'scoming to you or if your attitude is, I absolutely have to spend every dollar as profitably as possible,then you need to be using exact and phrase match with negative keywords or phrase match.But if you're, if you have a little bit more flexibility, if you have a little bit of a longer horizon,if you have from a from a cash flow perspective and you're able to invest a little bit in building agood account, that's the way to go.And that's really the best approach, which is why broad bar match modified, they all have their place,all the keyword match type because they all serve a purpose, they all serve a function.In the next lecture we're going to talk about phrase match in some detail and then exact match and thenwe'll carry on from there.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
