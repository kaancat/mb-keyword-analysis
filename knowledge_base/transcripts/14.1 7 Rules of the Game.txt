# 14.1 7 Rules of the Game

Hello and welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about seven things the modern advertising approach really requiresand seven things that you should never do.These are different things than when I started out in this business where we were really focusing onmanual CPC bidding, we were focusing primarily on ad copy.We were focusing primarily on keywords single keyword ad groups, exact match keywords, negative keywordlists.Um, and that was the game, right?Like that was really what we were doing.But as time went on over the last ten years, Google introducing more AI.Google introducing new features.Google relying more on audience signals and automation.The rules of the game have changed, and the more effective modern advertisers who are generating themost amount of profit are avoiding certain mistakes, and they're approaching their optimizations with,um, certain things in mind.And I want to walk you, walk you through the seven things that are really important, and seven thingsthat are important to avoid.Number one, know your audience deeply.When we looked at the Google Ads dashboard in a few lectures back, I said that you're going to spenda lot of time building out your custom audiences, and that's something which is really important.Before you build out your audiences, you have to know your audience.You have to know who these people are.And knowing who these people are requires you to understand the client's business.I tell my employees all the time, the number one thing that they can do to retain their clients isto learn everything they can about their client's business.It's really important research.Read the reports.Look at past legislature that that has impacted a client's industry.Research the competitors.Understand the manufacturing process.Understand how a client makes money.Understand what features and benefits that their products have.Get a sense of who is buying this and what problem in their life.The solution that you're advertising is solving.Know your audience deeply.Take the time.It's boring.It's difficult.It's it's it's rough.But take the time to really know and understand your audience deeply, and you're going to be able tothen go into your audience manager and build out audiences that are going to work, because you nowunderstand the pain points, the experiences, the personalities, the habits, the hobbies of the peoplewho are in the market for your products and services.Number two, implement effective exclusions.So exclusion lists and brand exclusions are important features of the modern advertising approach withinthe Google Ads ecosystem.It used to not be the case, but you have negative keywords.You have brand exclusion and exclusion audiences.Once you know your audiences, you're going to know who your audience isn't.Don't just rely on Google to use just their automation to figure out who your audience isn't.You should have a good sense of who your audience isn't, and use those exclusion lists at the campaignlevel and sometimes at the ad group level.If you're looking to potentially sculpt traffic into certain strategic ad groups within a campaign.Number three, connect your CRM.This is important.Obviously, if you're running an e-commerce store, you have to be sending in shopping feed.You have to be tracking revenue.You should be tracking profit.But if you're even if you're running lead gen, one of the biggest mistakes we see with most of ourlead gen clients who are using a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce, is they haven't connected their CRM.Most mainstream CRMs have a native easy integration with Google Ads.Make sure you connect it because as you track leads through the qualification process, you want tomake sure you're sending Google back those important signals so they learn over time which leads areturning into closed deals.As Google knows which leads turn into closed deals.Their algorithm is going to get better all the way back at the time, where they're setting a bid foran impression to, to to to have a better predicted conversion rate, to have a better predicted qualityof impression so they could set the right bid.You want to bid less for leads, less likely to turn into qualified deals or closed deals, and youwant to bid more for impressions that are more likely to turn into a form submission, or a phone call,or a lead that is likely going to make it further towards a closed deal.And that's information that is going to be stored in your CRM.Additionally, customer lists, email addresses, lists that have purchased that have that have becomeclosed deals, those are going to be able to you're going to be able to use those lists in your audiencecenter, in your audience manager in Google to find similar audiences.Similar to how meta has lookalike audiences.Google is going to be able to use those lists customer lists to find similar audiences, and connectingyour CRM is a really effective way of getting that done and just making that part of your habit.Number four craft compelling ad copy.We shouldn't have to say this, but it's actually more important to say now than ever before.Years ago, you had no automation.You had no AI.You had one headline, two headlines, right?You weren't putting in 15 headlines and it was clear that writing good ads really mattered.Google focused on a lot of automation and responsive search ads, where they're mixing and matching15 different headlines and four different descriptions.And it's this whole big thing.And now just by giving them giving Google your your URL and a couple of keyword ideas, they're goingto write all your ads for you.That's a huge mistake.Don't let Google write your ads for you.Don't be afraid to pin your best headlines in the first and second positions.Write compelling, um, compelling descriptions.We have lectures that talk about my rules for writing really good ads, but again, they have to bewell researched, use objective facts, understand the benefits and the features of your products.Understand what makes you unique.Be authentic.Speak authentically.Don't ever say that you're authentic.You can never use the word I'm authentic or we're authentic in our ads.Just say things that are actually are authentic and people will see you as authentic.So craft a compelling ad copy.Take the time to learn a little bit about copywriting.It does matter.Number five avoid overly broad targeting.If you're using just broad match and you're not using audience signals, your campaigns are not goingto perform well.Google has tons of really interesting dynamic ways of limiting the scope to target an audience thatis more likely going to be receptive to your message and are interested in your market.So targeting is keywords, targeting is audiences and custom segments and custom custom intent listsits affinity audience, its in-market segments, its remarketing, its its its geographic locations,its demographic locations.You don't want to over restrict.That's going to be one of the seven sins, but you also don't want to be overly broad.Number six focus on strategic management.This is the metrics that matter report.This is saying, hey, I know that there's a ton of things I could do here.I don't have all the time in the day.I don't have all the money in the world.Strategically.What am I trying to accomplish?I'm trying to get more sales.I'm trying to get more conversions.I'm trying to improve my bottom of the funnel campaigns be strategic.What am I trying to accomplish here and go after that type of optimization?And the Metrics that matter report is a great way to start.Number seven embrace continuous experimentation.This is something that I would say 90% plus of practitioners that I see fail at doing.They set up their campaigns and that's it.They come back in a month.But experimentation is really important because you don't know what's going to work.I don't know what's going to work.Nobody knows what's going to work.So you have to experiment.Google ads allows you to run experiments built in.Maybe I'm running a campaign that 50% of my budget is using manual CPC bidding, and 5,050% of my budgetis exploring target CPA or target return on ad spend bidding.That's a great experiment.Maybe I'm experimenting with different ad types.Maybe I'm experimenting between targeting an an observation with different audience signals.Maybe I'm experimenting with custom segments, maybe I'm experimenting with.Maybe I'm experimenting with different landing pages.There are so many different important experiments that you can run, and if you get in the habit ofincorporating experiments into your workflow, your campaigns are going to be much more effective.So if you keep these seven rules in mind, um, if you keep these seven rules in mind, you're goingto be absolutely winning the Google Ads game.Um, in the long run, there's no question about it.That's the seven things to keep in mind.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about the seven sins that you have to also keep in mind andmake sure that you avoid.I'll see you there in a moment.
