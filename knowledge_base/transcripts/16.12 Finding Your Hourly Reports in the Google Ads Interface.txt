# 16.12 Finding Your Hourly Reports in the Google Ads Interface

How do you relax fans?And welcome back.In the previous lecture we were talking about how we want to tell Google to treat our daily budget andthat gets involved with time and hour of day and ad scheduling and bid adjustments.But we're not going to talk about all of that right now.We'll talk about that when we get into ad scheduling.But I do want to quickly show you how you could see how your campaign's ad group's keywords have beenperforming based on certain hour of the day.So here we are back in a live Google ads campaign and we're going to go over to ad schedule.If you click on ad schedule over here in the secondary vertical navigation towards the bottom, we'llsee a breakdown of all the different stats based on different times of the day.So I could again sort this report by any metric that I'd like if I want to sort this report by cost.Where have we been spending the most amount of money again sorted by cost?And I could see that Sunday's all day has the greatest amount of spend on average, followed by Mondays,so on and so forth.But let's say I want to see our so I'll head over to the top and select our from this horizontal menu.And now I see all the different statistics, all the different dimensions broken out by our.So I could see 12 to 1, 11 to 12 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and if I read across I could see how many clickswe got during that time frame interaction rate, which is usually click the rate.Again, this is not the column set that I typically like.We'll talk about columns in another lecture cost, conversion rate, all those sorts of things, allthe different metrics that I'm looking at.And of course we can customize these columns to show all the different metrics and the things that Iwant.I could download this data into Excel and run pivot tables to see which times of the day have performedthe best for me.Say I want to filter say I see that my average conversion rate is 11%.Maybe I want to see which hours of the day have a higher than average conversion rate.So I click filter and I can look at performance or I'm sorry, conversion rate and I'll look at I'llgo over to conversions.Conversion rate.Conversion rate is greater than let's say 11.2%.And now we'll have a report that shows me all the times of the day that have an above average conversionrate, because I know that my average is at 11.1 and I can see the average of all the above averageis actually 33.7.So interesting.So now I'm actually walking you through some very specific optimizations and some techniques you shouldbe taking notes here.A couple of really good ways to optimize the spending in a campaign.So now I'll be able to see, okay, here are certain hours of the day, certain time segments that areperforming really, really well.I could sort by conversion rate again, you want to detect for anomalies and then I can go back intomy ad schedule and for my ad schedule I could go and add bid adjustments, I could increase bids orin certain times decrease bids or in certain times remove bids.And we're going to talk about that in the future lecture.I just want to show you how you could see that one other area that's actually pretty cool from a highlevel perspective.To see how your campaigns are performing during certain times of the day is to simply go back to thecampaigns overview.And of course, you could be under search campaigns, display campaigns, shopping campaigns are allcampaigns.And we're going to segment instead of going into our separate time ad schedule report, we're goingto click on this segment button over here above the the performance report go down to time and I canselect our of the day, month, quarter year, day of the weekend in our case because if we're if we'resort of assessing what's going on with this accelerated budget versus the standard budget setting thatwe talked about in the previous lecture, I want to break down hour of the day, because that's wherethese settings really affect.We're talking about daily budgets and daily delivery settings.That's what the settings we configured in the previous lecture.So I'm going to go ahead and click hour of the day and it's going to break down each of these campaignsand it's on Army time.So 0 to 23.And I could take a look here at every single one of these campaigns.How have the campaigns performed throughout certain hours of the day?So, for example, if your budget is too is small enough and the daily amount of impressions is largeenough and you're on accelerated, you might see something like 0 to 10, you're getting activity,you have clicks and impressions and then 11:00 am and on it just trails off your show and zero's acrossthe board.And if you see that, then you know that let's say that budget was $100, that I could spend $100 untilaround noon, which means I can probably spend another $100 in this campaign for the rest of the daywithout changing anything else.Of course, if you add more keywords, that equation changes because then you might run out of budgetat 7 a.m. or 9 a.m., depending on which keyword you add.Of course, if the dynamics and the competitive landscape changes, that could change.Of course, if your click through rate improves, that could change.If your click through rate improves, you might run out of your budget even earlier.See how that works?Another thing is that you might actually get different performance at different hours of the day.So while you might be able to spend $100 and get 100 clicks at a dollar, click until noon or let'ssay until 11 a.m., the clicks might get expensive or they might get less expensive throughout the secondpart of the day, all depending on the dynamics of the auction.We're going to talk about the dynamics of the auction, how the auction in Google ads actually works,how your bids are evaluated, how your max CPC works, how Google actually charges you, how click rating,quality score all play into that equation.But just know there are all these different variables that could affect it.But the point is, if you want to get a brief overview of your hour of day performance, go in segmentout by hour, or go check out your ad schedule, report and navigate over to the our area so you cansee a breakdown of how things are performing by hour that will inform when and what decision you shouldmake about your ad delivery settings, whether you want to be on accelerated or standard.And again, just to finish off, I do recommend almost all the time being on accelerated at the beginningin a brand new campaign.That's it for this lecture.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon and the very next lecture.
