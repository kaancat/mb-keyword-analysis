# 10.8 Top Search Campaign Tips

Welcome back.Let's talk about my top search campaign tips.Conduct thorough keyword research.This is really important.The Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush are your friends.Use tools to get a good understanding of how people are searching for your product.I get this all the time.I'm talking to a CEO, I'm talking to a marketing person inside a company, and they're telling me what'smost important to a to their customers.They're telling me what their customers are searching for.But then you go and do some research and you realize that, hey, there's a whole set of vocabulary,there's a whole language that the customers of a certain product or service are using.So do good.Do good keyword research.And one of my favorite ways of doing keyword research is just going to Google and looking at the autocompletesuggestions as I begin typing in queries, talking about searches, I look at related searches, thenI take those related searches and put them into Google Keyword Planner, put them into SEMrush and otherreally awesome tools.Many of these tools are free, so Evil.com is another great resource, and I find and generate an understandingof what people are searching for at different stages of the funnel.Focus on relevant and or high volume or low competition keywords.So this is really worthwhile.We talk about commercial intent a lot, but and what is well what is commercial intent mean?Commercial intent means that I'm expressing in my search query a willingness or desire to buy something.So I might be searching for if I'm selling fountain pens.Fountain pens for sale.Mother of the bride.Gowns for sale.Um, for carat.Lab grown diamond engagement ring.So those are all searches that indicate a product or service, right?I'm in.I'm in the market for something.Those are going to be more competitive and more expensive.But what about more informational queries like our lab grown diamonds?Real.So I'm.I have a client that sells a huge amount of of lab grown diamonds, and somebody searches for our labgrown diamonds.Real.Now, that's not a competitive search term.It's not a search term that expresses intent to purchase.But that could be a really relevant query to send to a blog post or an informational page on our e-commercesite that talks about the chemical makeup of lab grown diamonds.That can be a very effective way of bringing in middle higher of the middle top of the funnel prospectsto my website.We've seen this work countless times where whether it's an e-commerce business or a lead gen business,finding the whole area of of informational queries that really don't express intent or intent to purchase.But people who are learning more about a product, learning more about a solution, learning more abouta problem they have.And if we could send them to a page that that has video, it has images, it has text, it has informationthat explain or add context or enrich the customer.The prospect's understanding of of what they're looking to learn more about.Because the click is so much cheaper, even though the conversion rate is much lower, the Roas froma campaign like that, the return from a campaign like that could still be very strong and in many casesstronger than bottom of the funnel, intent driven search campaigns.Once you've done all that competitive research, keyword research, um, you understand the informationalsegment of your buyer's journey, organize those keywords into thematic ad groups.So you could group keywords by product category.By service category.You can group keywords by informational versus intent to purchase keywords.You could group keywords by location.You could group keywords And the thing about keyword grouping is you don't want to be arbitrary.So if you're a local service business that services 75 locations.So it's very likely that people will be searching for locksmith or or exterminator or florist in a location,and they'll use a zip code.They'll use a location in their search query.So that might be a great way to segment out ad groups, because then you'll have ads, headlines anddescriptions and a landing page that could all be location specific and that gives a more cohesive,relevant, timely customer journey.And when you're focusing those ad groups, you're building out those keyword lists.Make sure you could identify a single theme of that ad group.So for example, in our case of florists in a location, I would say, um, florists in Woodmere, NewYork is the theme of that ad group.Now, I might have another ad group that is that talks about color theory in creating floral bouquets.So I would I would say the theme of that ad group is color theory and bouquets.Now, I might have an ad group that's not so specific to color theory.It's more just general advice on on picking flowers.So that theme of that ad group would be picking flowers.And then any search query, whether it's color theory or smell or, or, um, varieties for specificlocations, when to use certain types of flowers, that those would all be appropriate to be in thatad group.If I'm sending them to one sort of central page on the site that that talks about that topic more broadly.So how you there's no right or wrong way to group your keywords thematically.You want to think about where you're sending that traffic.You want to think about how you could tailor your ad copy to any of the searches, or any of the keywordsin that ad group, and you want to talk about you want to think about the the things that matter tothe customer, like location, like service category, like product category.For example, for the Adventure Academy, we have a Google um campaign, and one of the ad groups haslike maybe 7 to 10,000 keywords, and they're all high level informational about how to do certain thingsin Google, how to set up pmax, how to find the auction insights report.What is search impression share?These are questions that people ask Google.So we have a it's it's the theme is how to.And our headlines are all going to be learn Google ads in detail from the expert.So I'm not a now my headline does not specifically address um the search impression share tool becauseI don't have a specific page or content on our site that addresses search impression share in particular.Yeah.If this was completely built out with tremendous amount of nuance, then maybe we would have a pageon the site that talks about each of these individual topics and a link to to enroll in the course,whatever it may be.But like that's difficult.And I don't know that.I don't know how much positive impact that would actually have and much of it, much of it could bemarginal.So to me, the thematic grouping in that one ad group makes a lot of sense.A really great trick for thinking of ad group and campaign structure is refer to your website's hierarchy,and you could think about mirroring your site's navigational structure.So oftentimes you'll have services and you'll have a service service level categories.Um, let's say you're a you're a construction company.So you might have remodeling.You might have kitchen design.You might have new builds.You might have gut renovation.You might have inspections.You might be an e-commerce business.An e-commerce business is really easy.You might have top level categories in each category.You might have subcategories.And each and in sub categories you might have second or third layer subcategories.You could build out your campaign structure that follows your website's hierarchy.And one of the great things to do about that, or one of the great reasons to to refer to your websitehierarchy, is then you sort of naturally have landing pages and collection pages.Those final URLs Earls built out for every individual ad group.Lastly, think about segmenting campaigns by key factors the things that matter.The top products or services that you want to promote.Um, you might be like, we can go back to our our lab grown diamond example.You might have lots of different categories bracelets, bangles, rings, studs, loose diamonds, necklaces,engagement rings.But you know that 70% of your revenue comes from engagement rings.So then you're going to have you might have a dedicated 5 or 6 campaigns for engagement rings, andthen you might have a single campaign for tennis bracelets.A single campaign for studs.A single campaign for men's jewelry.So think about segmenting campaigns out by top categories, top services.And then the other big factor that could often come into play is specific geographic locations for targetedads.For example, I might also ship to Canada, but I know that my Canadian conversion rate and my Canadianaudience is much less likely to buy because I'm really a US based company, so I could have a campaignthat only targets the US, and that's where I have more aggressive bidding.I have more padding in my CPA or Roas targets to acquire a customer, and I can have another campaignthat's only targeting Canada that has a lower budget running maybe some more tests.And and I'm bidding less aggressively on that traffic because I know historically it's not going toconvert as well.When you're building out search campaigns, you want to limit segmentation to essential cases.So again, you don't want to be overly segmented.You don't want to have 1000 ad groups inside a campaign.In most cases you don't want to have 1 or 2.You don't want 1 or 2 keywords in an ad group.You don't want to segment out a campaign just for mobile and a a campaign just for a desktop.If you ship equally to all 50 states, you definitely don't want campaigns for each of the 50 states.Um, so you can go crazy with segmentation.And if you're just looking for segmentation for the sake of reporting, you don't need to do that.Because when you build out reports and the reporting tool, you could add a lot of segmentation later.So only segment when necessary, like some of those big use cases we just discussed.And ensure that you have sufficient data aggregation for effective machine learning optimization.When you segment out your campaigns to drastically or too with too much detail, and I have all thesead groups, an ad group for phrase match and mobile, an ad group for exact match, and mobile, anad group for broad match, and mobile, an ad group for exact match and desktop.Right?Like Google is now going to be trying to rotate all of these impressions across these remarketing,these rsas, these responsive search ads.And it's going to take too long, and it's going to be impossible for Google to get meaningful datato find the combinations of things that are essentially working well.And hyper personalization, hyper segmentation does not work.Leverage audience targeting.Um, this is something which is a must for every search campaign.Use your in-market affinity and custom intent audiences, at least on observation mode.Use remarketing lists to re-engage past visitors.You could use your remarketing lists in search campaigns.You could use display campaigns for remarketing.You could use pmax for remarketing.So really re-engage your past visitors.That's an important thing and something not to forget.Even when you're building out a search campaign.Very important to use smart bidding strategies.Target CPA and target Roas are the two most important smart bidding strategies to test and understand.We discussed in detail what each of those strategies are and what they do.Third, maximize conversions.That's the third best because it's well, you're telling Google to at least get you revenue generatingactions, even if it's not capped or moderated by a particular, um, CPA target or, or margin target.And when you're building out these campaigns and you're applying targeted, you're applying automatedbidding strategies.Let machine learning optimize bids in real time.Give it the time it needs.You're typically going to need two weeks before you make any drastic changes to an account like we discussed?So patience is a really important virtue when working on successful search campaigns.Add extensions like we discussed sitelink extensions, call out extensions, structured snippets, structuredsnippet extensions and price extensions are really important.It's worth it to take a few extra minutes.And when you're building out your rsas, use those extensions.If you know you're going to be having a lot of rsas and a bunch of ad groups, put those build thoseextensions at the account level.That way you could select them all for any rsas you create, and you don't have to recreate them fromscratch and important and worthwhile to use dynamic search ads.Dynamic search ads, which we're going to discuss and show in a lot more detail, are ads in an ad grouptype or a campaign type where you actually don't write any headlines.And this is really, really valuable for those informational capturing all that higher level, cheaperinformational query.If you might have a blog on your website with 1000 blog posts or 30 blog posts, or a bunch of FAQ pages,or informational or educational resource pages, you could give Google just the URLs.Google will scan, read the page, understand what that page is about, and Google will write your headlinesfor you.And Google will actually bid on keywords for you.You're not selecting keywords and you're not writing headlines, but you're able to potentially capturea lot of that middle, higher funnel traffic, um, where you don't need extensive keyword research,extensive keyword segmentation.You're testing to see if I could send cheap informational traffic to these content rich pages.And Google will do all the heavy lifting with the creatives.I'm just I just want to see a test.Can we make this work with conversion rate?And can we generate profitability from dynamic search ads, where Google is dynamically deciding tobid and dynamically writing our ad headlines to see how much of that cheaper middle, top or funneltraffic we can capture.Now we're going to get into the details of setting up your first campaign in the very next lecture.I will see you shortly.
