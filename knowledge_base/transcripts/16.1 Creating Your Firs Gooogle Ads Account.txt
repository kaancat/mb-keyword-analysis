# 16.1 Creating Your Firs Gooogle Ads Account

How do you Google that's fans and welcome back in this section we're going to go ahead and create ourvery first Google ads account.Now, remember, if you already have a Google ads account and you know how to configure all the basicsettings, feel free to skip around.Throughout these following lectures, we're going to go through each individual setting that you'refaced with when you go to create your first Google AdWords Google Ads account.And we're going to talk in a bit of detail about each setting and some strategies and potential scenarios,how you'd want to configure them for your own specific business.Remember, there's no hard and fast rule.There's no specific rights or wrongs.There are certain settings, and I'll let you know when we come across them that Google is specificallytrying to trying to get you to spend more money.And in most of those cases, you're not going to necessarily want to go along with those default settings.And I'll and I'll let you know when we come across things of that nature.But in almost every other setting, when it comes to languages and devices and location settings, it'sreally going to vary to each individual business and even within a business, depending on a specificadvertising objective.But we will get into detail about all those settings.So I think it's worthwhile to check that out.Again, all you really need to get started is an Internet connection, a computer and a Google account.If you don't have a Google account, let's jump into the computer.If you don't have a Google account, head over to Google.com and click sign in and then create an account.But most of you already have a Google account.If you don't have a Google ads account, let's go ahead and create our very first Google ads accountnow.So you're going to go over to Google.com and you can search for Google ads.Right.And you could click on the first result or over here at Google.com.You could also alternatively go to ads at Google.com and hit enter.And you're going to be shown this Google Ads home page.You're going to click sign in in the upper right hand corner or start now over here, this green button.And of course, this page is going to change from time to time.So we're going to go ahead and click sign in and you're going to go and sign in with your actual credentials.And this is an account that I created for the sake of this course, and I have a bunch of these burneraccounts to go back to the beginning, so on and so forth, things of that nature.And I'm not going to take care of that at the moment.Click done and Google is going to log us in.This is the very first page that you're going to see when you create a new Google ads account.Many of you already have Google ads accounts and you might want to follow along with us when we getto campaign settings.Once we get to our campaign settings screen over here, I'm going to show you how to go back to getto the screen that we're going to be on.But over here you have your asked, what is your main advertising goal?Now I want to skip this.So we're going to it's very important.We're going to click skip the guided setup.Many of you have written to me that you don't see the screen that I'm on, and that's because back onthis screen over here, you clicked.One of these objectives, get more calls.Google offers you these goals to simplify the campaign set up structure.And again, this is sort of one of the ways that Google.Yeah, I think that Google is trying to simplify it a little bit, but they're also trying to get youto spend more money because they take away some of the flexibility and customizability you have whenit comes to setting up your campaigns.If you choose one of these goals, so get more website sales or signups, visits to your to your physicallocation.What happens if we if we click one of these objectives, let's say I click pick goal.Google is going to launch me into a much more simplified version of Google ads, and we don't want that.It's going to ask my business name.And almost all, all of the keywords, the ad group structure is going to be automated.I'm going to have the ability to just create my ad set up billing and boom, I'm off to the races.All the the really advanced techniques and topics we're going to cover will not be available if we gothrough one of these, what they call guided setups.So I'm going to go back and I'm going to click Skip this guy that set up.Just make sure to do that.It's very important.The next screen we're on is Google asking us what type of campaign we we want to set up.Now, this isn't Google trying to make us spend more money.This you actually have to choose because each type of campaign is drastically different.And the old version of AdWords, you were able to select the campaign type in a in a in a followingor subsequent step in the process.But this is actually a better place to choose this campaign type.You could create an account without a campaign.And if I click this, I'm going to go right into my billing portal where you're going have to set upyour information, your credit card, etc., etc..But we actually do want to go ahead and create a campaign together.Now we're going to create our first campaign.I'm going to go ahead and click on Search Campaign.And again, we're offer to choose a goal, whether it be sales leads or website traffic.And if I choose one of these goals, you see how Google really wants us to choose one of these predeterminedgoals.They're very adamant that we do that, but we're going to learn how to be more sophisticated Googleads practitioners.We're going to learn how to be true experts, and we're going to be able to customize every settingto meet our own goals, especially as our goals change over time.So we're going to click down here, create a campaign without a goal.And if you if you even look at the subtle things like just the iconography over here, you have thislike sort of don't enter, sign under, create a campaign without a goal.You naturally don't think that that's a button that a click.It's all the way down here that Google really wants you to click one of these things.So we're going to go ahead and click Create a campaign without a goal.Remember to do that because if you want to follow along with us on the next steps, it's going to bevery important that you're following along step by step here.So we're going to go create a campaign without a goal.And again, Google asks us one more time the type of results you want to get from this campaign.Now, there's nothing wrong with choosing any of these options.You could choose all three.I could choose none of them.Of course, the goal for most campaigns is going to be website visits, conversions, phone calls.Now, if I click website visits as a goal, Google is going to ask me to put in my website and they'lluse that later on in different in different aspects of the account.They might offer me to create some dynamic search ads.We'll talk about what those are.They might give me some keyword suggestions.At this point, you're not you're not limiting yourself.If I select any of these options, I'm not limiting any of the control I'm going to have in the followingstep.Google just might auto suggest something different based on what I select here.So this is not like choosing one of the guided set up structures that they tried to get me to do twicebefore.I'm going to type in WW w dot pop, cnn.com.And for those of you new to this course, we're going to be using pop in quite a bit.It just happens to be I really don't have any specific reason why I've chose Pop and I like the company.I think it's cool they sell office products online.It's a good example and we'll use other sites for examples as well.But we're going to come back to this site a lot.It's a typical ecommerce site.We're going to learn about navigation from them.We're going to learn about different campaign structure, ideas, so on and so forth.I'm going to type that in.I'm going to go ahead and click Continue.And if you're creating this account in this first campaign for yourself, I would highly recommend enteringin your website and choosing website visits as a goal you'd like to have.The screen we're on now is where there's a huge amount of different campaign settings that are goingto be able to configure.If we just scroll down this page, you'll see all the different things we can do.And once we click additional settings, you see that many more options appear.Once you twirl down that menu.And each one of these has a submenu with different strategies and different techniques and differentoptions, and it's quite overwhelming.And there is a lot to consider here and we're going to go through each one step by step.The first thing Google asks us to do is name our campaign.But before we go ahead and name a campaign, we need to learn a little bit about how to structure aGoogle ads account, understanding that the account hierarchy, understanding all these different typesof things.Then we're going to set up our ad groups, we're going to create ads, we're going to set up our billing.And there's going to be a lot between now and then that we're going to learn.For those of you who already have a Google ads account and you didn't follow this progression to getto the screen, let me quickly show you how to get back to the screen.So if you want, you can follow along with us step by step.You probably have a Google ads account that might look something similar to this.You're going to go to all campaigns or search campaigns at the campaigns tab in the secondary horizontalmenu, and then you're going to click the blue button, which indicates creating a new campaign.Go ahead and click that click new campaign.And now you're going to be back to where we started in the beginning of this lecture.We're going to go ahead and click search, create a campaign without a goal, continue.And now you'll be on the same page that we're on and you'll be able to follow along with us step bystep, even if you already have a Google Ads account.So now we should all be here together.And in the next lecture we're going to start talking about understanding the hierarchy of the GoogleAds account, understanding a little bit about navigation and how we should think about structuringour Google ads accounts to maximize the efficiency and the organization of our data.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
