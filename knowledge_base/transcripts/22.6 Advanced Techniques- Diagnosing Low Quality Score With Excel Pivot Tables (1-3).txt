# 22.6 Advanced Techniques- Diagnosing Low Quality Score With Excel Pivot Tables (1-3)

How do you Edwards fans.Welcome back to this exciting chapter where as promised we're going to go into Microsoft Excel intoa live account as you're seeing here.And take a look at how we could diagnose a quality score issues in our account how we could identifyand point out quality score problems.So let's get to it.What you're seeing here is a lot of obviously the keywords are blurred out and some of the more personaland sensitive data because this is a client of ours and not they probably don't want their keywordsand cost data to be seen by the world.But this is a live account and the data is absolutely real.So before we prepare our report we're going to export.We want to make sure we have certain columns set up.Now we here we see a bunch of different columns this is what we have for the specific client you wantto for sure make sure that your Quality Score column is active to do that.All you got to do is go to columnsCollins modify columns and under attributes make sure quality score is added over here it happens tobe added.Let's say we had removed it and it wasn't showing us.Go ahead and click the Add button to add the column for quality care.That's something we already saw how to do in a previous video but repetition is good.We also want to make short impressions are are active and usually your impressions will be a columnthat's active by default.We have it right here.So just make sure your impressions clicks and pression clicks and cost Collin's are also active so theones the imperative columns are quality score clicks impressions and cost.Once you have that done click Apply now.I just went over right into the campaigns tab for all my campaigns so you might have been.You might start off with the campaigns tab here but just make sure you navigate over to the keywordscolumn and as you could see we have some display campaigns and search campaigns running.And because display campaigns don't have quality scores.We only want to export our keywords that have qualities of course that we can do that by setting upa really easy filter.So I'm going to go ahead click filter create filter will cover filters in more depth in a future videobut this is just a great overview to the filtering tool.So we're going to click Create Filter and my first parameter is going to be quality scores click thedropdown menu and a fine quality score at the bottom or select greater or equal to 1.So this will make sure that any keywords that export will have a quality score.I'm also going to want to just take a look at my active viewers because we have a whole bunch of posteskey words in this account and that may be a personal preference you might want to take a look at keywords you might want to take a look at.Just active keywords but for now we're going to go and just select active keywords to do that.I click the dropdown menu once again I find status towards the bottom and matches any eligible or eligiblelimit.So these are the active keywords in the account and we can see more sub parameters over here.So I know go ahead and click apply.And that's going to apply my filter to my data set below.And then to twirl this box up to give me some more space I don't want to click click I wanna click thislittle triangle and then I'll be able to just minimize the filter and see all my data here.Now that we have all active keywords selected and all the key words to have a quality score I couldexport this report by clicking the download icon to the left of the search box in the upper menu.So in a quick downward download download report and it's something we've also done before.I'm going to choose my format to be Excel which is a CSP.I don't need to say I'm going to go ahead and simply click download.So now that I have my report open in Excel we can start analyzing the data and going through it to findsome really interesting information specifically for our purposes to analyze and determine quality scoresore spots.The ADD group column.I change the names I kind of fictionalize or exemplified some of the names here of the groups just forthe sake of protecting our clients privacy.But all the other data has been remained has remained intact and it is actual live data and the firstthing I want to do is create a pivot pivot tables as you know are really great tools to analyze informationin different ways and look at numbers in different ways.And to do that we're going to select the data we want to use for our pivot tables and go ahead and selectall our columns and I get to go to insert and hit pivot table.Now your version of Excel may very well look quite different if you're using an older version of MicrosoftOffice.But essentially the functionality of the pivot table is the same thing it's just the iconography isdifferent the color scheme is different and it might be in a different place but it's usually underInsert pivot table.If you don't see the option for inserting a pivot table just go ahead and go into the Help section andstart typing and pivot and you'll be able to see exactly where to start where to find your pivot tabletool.So I can go ahead and click pivot table.They're going to ask me to verify the data range which I selected so that's exactly the range I wantto work with I have a click OK.And now I have my pivot table in a new sheet to the first thing I'm going to go ahead and do is namemy pivot table name and Pivot Table 1 because we're going to create a couple of pivot tables in thistutorial and this video zoom in here so everyone can get a good view of what's going on.We want to go ahead and add in the builder the first and foremost quality score as our row label.So we find quality scores here which is right here selected and by default that went into the valuesI want to drag it into a rolled label.So now I have Rowly was 9:59.This is my quality score.I then want to add my clicks OK.So I have count of clicks.Let's go to one thing the number of clicks per quality score and I also want to include the sum of impressionsin Google primarily cares about impressions.Google makes money by impression.And we want to know the percentage of impressions for a specific quality score range.So we want to click some of impressions so we're going to add impressions as a value for a column.And we're going to it by default impressions if you see here came in is counted impressions if I clickthe info I'll be able to change it to some of impressions.So now I have a sum of impressions by quality score.So I want to format this column to include commas to make it easier for us to see so under format columnsright format cells.I'll go to a number.Use 1000 separator with zero decimal places and click OK.And now I could see a much clearer view of what's going on here.So we have for this date range selecting which the last month we have six million eight hundred fortyone thousand and 504 impressions and now it's all broken down.Now it's all broken down by quality scores so for example keywords with a 1 quality score.There was one click and 150 1000 impressions key words with 9696 clicks 176 thousand impressions and in fact this has to be changed to some of clicks
