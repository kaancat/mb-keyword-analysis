# 4.3 Keyword Match Types

Welcome back.Let's talk about keyword match types.We know that keywords are the words and phrases that you load into Google inside your ad groups thatGoogle will use as a guide when determining whether or not to trigger an ad for any given search query.But how loosely related can a search query be to your keyword?That is what you control with match types.We learned that negative keywords are ways to block a search query from triggering an ad.For example, if I sell women's shirts or I sell linen blouses and my keyword is linen blouses.Google might trigger my ad if somebody searches for kids linen blouses or children's linen blouses.But if I add children or kids as a negative keyword, Google will never trigger an ad for any searchquery that contains kids or children.However, there are other ways to control the specificity that Google has to approach matching up yourkeywords and search terms with.At the broadest level, we have what's called broad match keywords.When you load those into your account, you're going to either be able to select the match type froma list and the match type column, or when you're loading in keywords in bulk, you could actually typecertain symbols to indicate to Google what match type you want those keywords to be.So broad match is just the phrase.So for example, the keyword is women's hats.Any search related to women's hats, including synonyms, related searches, and misspellings, willtrigger an ad close match variants include synonyms, related searches, and misspellings.So Google will say that close matched variants will trigger ads even with a certain match type modifierapplied.Next we have phrase match.Phrase match is the keyword in quotation marks, and it triggers ads for searches that include the meaningof the keyword, including close variants but maintaining the word order.So when something is in phrase match, you have to have the exact query in the correct order in orderfor it to trigger an ad.However, other words before and after what's in the parentheses?I'm sorry, what's in the quotation marks can trigger an ad.So for example, if our phrase match keyword is women's hats, hats for women would not trigger an adbecause it's out of order.However, women's hats for kids might still trigger an ad if kids was not a negative keyword becausewomen's hats appears in the search query as you have it in quotations.Exact matches as it sounds, it's the keyword or the phrase in brackets, and in order for it to triggeran ad, the search query has to have the exact term or very close variant with the same meaning.So that means women's hat would probably show or Um with woman hat would probably show.Female hat might show even with an exact match bracket around it.But if somebody searches for women's hats on sale, it will not show.Or if somebody searches for yellow women's hats or online women's hats, it's not going to show up becauseyou're using the brackets to really tell Google.I only want to trigger ads for this specific set of words in this specific order, and negative matchis using the negative sign negative women's hats.And if negative women's hats is loaded as a negative keyword, no query containing women's hats is goingto trigger one of your ads.Here are a few good call outs when you're looking at match types, and you're trying to think aboutyour match type strategy as you build out your campaigns and your ad groups.So broad match keywords typically cannibalize the ad group in the campaign.So they're the most broad.They're going to let in the most amount of search traffic, and they're going to generally get the mostvolume, the most clicks, the most cost.If you have other keywords inside that same ad group with similar match types or with different matchtypes.Rather, there are numerous ways to set up campaigns and ad groups.With keyword match types, you can have a separate ad group for every different match type.So oftentimes we'll have a a, an ad group inside a campaign for exact match keywords, and then thesame exact keywords and phrase match and the same exact keywords in broad match.And typically you'd give a higher bid to your exact match keywords, a slightly lower bid to your phrasematch keywords, and a broader, lower cost bid to your broad match keywords.However, with modern advertising, what we found is to start with broad match keywords and use smartbidding.If you use smart bidding well and your conversion tracking is set up correctly, you could actuallyfind much more profit and Google will find far more customers for you than if you're limiting Googleusing search, query, or keyword modifiers.Regularly update your negative keywords to maintain traffic quality.This is an easy one, but many practitioners forget to do this.As you search through your keywords and your search term report and your history, you're going to eventuallyfind lots of search terms and lots of traffic that just isn't converting.So make sure to at the start of your campaign, find the obvious negative keywords.So if you have a brand that there's certain words or phrases could often be confused for a movie oran actor or some other product.Make sure to add that as a negative keyword.A general good rule of thumb is to have 10 to 20 keywords in each ad group.Keeping the number of keywords manageable ensures that your ads are highly relevant to those searchqueries.Because remember, all of the keywords inside an ad group are going to all be related connected to ato an ad, or a group of ads inside that ad group.So if you have three ads, for example, in an ad group, all three of those ads can theoretically showfor any of the 20 keywords in your ad group.So you want to make sure that the headlines and the descriptions and the landing pages associated withthe ad and the ad group all fit and match any of the keywords in your ad group.So if I have an ad that is specifically talking about yellow fountain pens, then I want to make surethat all the keywords in that ad group are referencing yellow fountain pens.If I'm sending them to a specific collection page around yellow fountain pens and my headlines talkabout yellow fountain pens.If I have a broader campaign that just talks about fountain pens in general, so then I might have alarger list of keywords with all the different colors, all the different styles.If I'm just sending them to a general fountain page collection, um, landing page on our website.Group keywords that share the common theme or intent.So again, we talked about tailoring website copy depending on where the person or the user is in thefunnel.So if I know in my business there are certain search queries that could contain a model number or amanufacturer part or a specific brand name, or you're looking for a coupon code or a discount.Things that indicate that a person is lower down in the funnel, more ready to buy.Then you might want to group those keywords inside an ad group, so you could send them to more relevantpages on the site.And you could also tailor the messaging for more conversion centric messaging, because you have a goodidea or a good sense that that person is lower down in the funnel.And finally, write ad copy that closes matches the intent and theme of the keywords in each ad group.Just like we just said, that's going to improve your ad relevance.And in turn, if you remember from quality score, that's going to increase your quality score.And the higher your quality score, the higher your ad rank is without having to raise your bid.And the higher your ad rank is, the better real estate you're going to get on the page.The higher click through rate you're going to have, and then the higher expected click through ratethat you're going to have, which is going to further increase your quality score.And it will be a positive cycle of gains inside your account.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about the search terms report and how to use it most effectivelyfor your research and your analysis.
