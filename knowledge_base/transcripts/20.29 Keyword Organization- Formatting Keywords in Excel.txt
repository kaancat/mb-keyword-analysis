# 20.29 Keyword Organization- Formatting Keywords in Excel

How do Google fans?Welcome back.Now that we have the themes, which is really synonymous with with the age groups that we want to runfor, this campaign figured out based on pulling the essential components and organizing our keywordresearch, I can now do a couple of easy things.I'm going to copy all my themes over here.I'm just going to select them and command copy.And I have a new Themes tab and I'm going to paste them in here to make them to sort of start cleaningthings up a little bit and type.I like to just talk about what type of breakdown is this?This is a service breakdown as a product type breakdown.So I'm going to call this product type.It.Maybe it's a location breakdown.Modifier attribute is like that cheap discounted.Are there these additional terms that a person could use in conjunction?That's not a theme itself.It's not unimportant, but it could be used in conjunction with one of your keywords and one of thesead groups to really drastically change the dynamics of the auction.What you would want to pay for a bid.So over here we have something like cheap discounted.Sale coupon, things like that.So these would be all be attributes.So now I understand my themes and understand my ad groups.I understand the breakdown of the type of of structure we're going to be using.And now I want to start going out and actually building out this ad group structure so I can do thisone by one by starting off with one ad group and then building them out easily by by doing a bunch ofcopy paste and find them in places and things like that.I'm going to show you how this is all done.So let's start off with the first one ergonomic.I'm going to copy it.I'm going to go into my ad group structure tab and I have a few different columns.I have campaign office chairs, all my different ad groups, the keyword formatted keyword and the matchtype.All right.So first, I'm going to go into ad group and click paste.So now I have ergonomic and we're going have a lot of different keywords inside this group.So like ergonomic office chair.Ergonomic desk chair.Ergonomic office seating.Ergonomic.It's just ergonomic chair.Let's say.I can go back into my keyword research to see if I'm missing anything.You know, it looks like I'm basically covering my ground.Now, again, in your case, while you're doing this, you might have a much bigger list for each individualgroup.There might be a lot more going on.But remember, I want to bid on these with all different match types.Right?So I want to have broad match, modified, broad, exact and phrase.So I want to copy this over four times so I can do.Copy and then.Paste.Paste again.Paste again.One, two, three, four, four.Bromance, modified, broad, exact phrase.And that should basically cover me.So I'm going to do the first four phrase match.Well, rather, it's going to be these are all four different keywords, a phrase exact.Broad.And Beam and I'm going to select all four of these and then just continue to drag down and a duplicatedfour times same pattern.Right.Freeze.Exact broad freeze.Exact.So we don't need freeze match in there.Delete these real quick.Great.The reason we're going to have this is going to allow us to format the keyword because we're going towant to eventually be able to copy and paste back into Google ads.And let me just give you just a caveat.There are easier ways to do this.There are simpler ways to do this.There are softwares out there that let you use this.I'm going to show you a couple of quick tools that are even free, but I think it's very good to beable to do this in Excel because once you have all this data formatted properly, you could stay inExcel and do a really cool things.You could create pivot tables to visualize your campaign structure.And I'm going to show you how to do that and just getting a familiarity with all this and how this works.It's really, really useful.So that's our ergonomic aide group.And I'm going to pull down ergonomic by dragging the lower right hand corner.And now we have our ergonomic aide group.Now let's just do one more together, and then the rest will speed up the video so you don't have towatch.I'm going to go back into my themes.I'm going to take rolling.All right.So now I'm going to copy and paste everything here.Just copy selected paste.And now.I'm going to select everything that I just copied and do a fine and replace.So everything that was ergonomic, I now want to be rolling.So I'm going to do edit.Find.Replace and I'm going to find ergonomic.And replace it with rolling and replace all.All right.They made 32 replacements.Fantastic.And now I have rolling group rolling as the name of the group and rolling office chair.And I replaced all those.And now I'm getting a really big keyword list and I'm going to go and continue to do this.And there's no point in watching me step by step, which is going to waste time.But we'll pick up with the magic of video editing in just a second.Welcome back.So I built out the entire campaign structure based on how we did our research, and we wanted to separateour keywords by theme.So we have rolling, ergonomic, luxury executive, colorful white computer, a few different variationsin each different match type.The first thing we do is go to campaign name and just double click on the bottom right hand corner tofill it in to the very bottom.So now I know that this is all going in my office chairs campaign and this column is going to be usefulonce we look at pivot tables to sort of get a visualization.Now, the problem we left with here is that they're not formatted properly.Phrase match we know has quotations, exact match, has brackets, bar mesh, modified has plus signs.So I have a few handy formulas over here which you guys could copy and paste and use for your own formattingif you can do this in Excel.But let's go and do this together real quick.So let's say we want to format because when we copy and paste and go back up into into Google ads,we want to make sure that our keywords are formatted properly.So we're going to go in first filter by, let's say, phrase match first.And if you don't know how to do a filter, you highlight your top row and you could toggle your filterson and off so we can take off the filter.And now if I hit the filter again and turn on the filter, now we have the filter.So I'm first going to toggle by phrase match.So I'm going to deselect everything in that filter by clicking that little arrow icon and selectingphrase.And now I have all my keywords throughout all my different campaigns, throughout all my different adgroups that are phrase match keywords.So simple enough, we're going to click equals and then we're going to click the quotations and thento individual parentheses quotations again.Then we're going to do the ampersand, the cell that we want to that's right directly to the left ofour formatted keyword cell, which is the keyword, the ampersand again.Quotations again to single apostrophes.Again, quotations again.And hit enter.And now I have ergonomic office chair in quotations.It took the keyword from c two and it turned it into the same keyword in the proper formatting for phrasematch.And now all I need to do is simply drag down to the very bottom here.And now everything is filled out properly.Really?It's magic.Now, let's take a look.If we if we take out our phrase match filter and we select all again, we'll see that only our phrasematch keywords have been filled in.Now let's do this for exact match.Simple enough.We're going to deselect everything and just select exact match.And we're going to do the formula as follows equals quotations.Bracket Left bracket quotations.Ampersand.The cell that our keyword is in, in the same row ampersand quotations, right bracket quotations enter.And now we have ergonomic desk chair formatted properly in brackets and again double click on the block.And again, we're just going to hold and drag down to the bottom here.And everything is filled in with brackets, all our exact match keywords.And now let's take a look at how that looks.We could select all again, that works out well.And now let's take a look at broad match modified.So again, we're going to filter out everything but broad match modified.So we're just going to paste in the formula for changing everything to broad match modified and we'regoing to switch this a one to C five because that's the cell.That this correlates with and click enter.And now there's a plus sign magically inserted in front of every single word.And I'm going to again drag that down to the bottom.Now all our keyboards are properly formatted except for broad match, and broad match is properly formatted,but we want to pull it into this column easy enough.Let's just do another filter.Let's get broad match and we're just going to simply do really simple formula equals equals this cellclick enter.And just drag it down again to the very bottom.And we should be good to go.One last step.I select everything again now.Column D the formatted keyword are all still formulas.So when we want to copy and paste back into Google ads, we need to make sure that we're copying values.I highlight column D Hit Command or control C for copy command or control V for paste.And this little icon I want to click and say Values only, select values only.And now there's no more formulas, right?It's all the actual values.So I can deselect and I can really just get rid of this column here, the keyword column.I can get rid of my filters.I don't need those anymore.But you can also leave the filtering ability on.So now I have a, a list of organized keywords based on thematically related groups of keyword keywords.I know that they're going to be going to the right place because they're in the separate ADD groups.They're all part of a specific campaign.If I highlight column C, I'll see I have 145 keywords, and this is based out of research.It's based out of different variations, but we haven't dealt with cheap discounts or sale yet, andwe're not going to deal with that in Excel.There's different ways you could deal with that.You could either add them as keywords and do the same thing with phrase match and different match types.You might want to add those as negative keywords.You might want to have separate add groups that contain those keywords and maybe do some traffic sculptingand ad sale or negative at the aggregate level as negative.You guys know all about traffic sculpting.Let me get rid of these formulas here to just clean up the sheet and clear my formatting.And now we have an actual list of what I think will be a very, very good way to start off this campaignwith structured ad groups.We still haven't figured out what we're going to be bidding either as default ad group bids or at keywordlevel bids.Because again, that's another way you could treat these modifier terms that say like sale discountedcheap.If you want them to be negative keywords, you could add them into these existing aggregates and havea lower manual starting bid cost per click bid.That would be probably the approach that I would take.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about visualizing a campaign build, using a pivot table,and then getting these keywords back into Google ads.So I hope this has been helpful and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
