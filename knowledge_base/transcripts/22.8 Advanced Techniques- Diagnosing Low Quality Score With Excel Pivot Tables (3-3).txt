# 22.8 Advanced Techniques- Diagnosing Low Quality Score With Excel Pivot Tables (3-3)

OK so I have my Some of impressions I make some quality times the person is now to get my normalisedquality score I create a new column.I'll name a label it normalize quality score.OK.And we're going to create a very simple formula.So it's going to be equals the sum of mice of my of my Some of quantised wartimes impressions columnwhich over here is D4.OK.Divided by myself of impressions which over here is E-4.OK.And I'm going to go ahead and drag this formula down to the bottom and we have one error here becausethis is not showing us any values of cost obviously.Looks like there were no clicks in this specific group so we can we just we could just totally ignorethat for now that's not a big deal.I'm going to make this just two decimal places like the other one by formatting the cells number.And now I'll be able to pair this up with my original average quality score.SoI could select columns DENI because I don't need them any more which is some of Questcor times impressionsand the some impressions just hide those for now.And I can now get a very nice clear view.So we've now we've done some very interesting tricks and we could actually start discovering some veryinteresting things now that we have that weighted quietist.All right.We understand how what how averages could lie right on average our average quality can lie because it'snot taking into account how weighted the specific keywords in each group are.As we saw in that example of those two keywords we had the twenty thousand impressions with a 4 qualityscore and five impressions with a 10 quality score where our average would have been at seven.Right our straight average would have been a 7.But taking into account the heavily weighted keyword with 20000 presses just a for quality score weactually would have had a quality score.A normal Esquire's or closer to a four.So we here we see in let's say this group called Cash we spent 3500 bucks and it's pretty it's prettyequal right.So we had a 7.9 average with 7.5 normalize so we didn't see anything too interesting there.But how about over here.Make kicks online it is the one that spent 122 grand a six point three average quality score and a sixnormalized quaters course over here we're seeing lower normalized quality score.Here's another interesting one.This keyword this quad travel with spending $11000.Still at this it's a high spending aggregate spent spent spent 11 and a half thousand dollars with a7.4 quality score.I might have gone in there and done some work.But in fact when we take the normalized quaters core we're really looking at an eight point three twoand even more so in this in this group travel exact it's a lower spending group it only has it's onlyspent $159.But it's a higher weighted quality score so sometimes you'll find higher quality scores when we'd getthe normalized quality or sometimes you'll find lower quality scores.But what we learned here are two very important fundamental things.One is all three things really because we learned how to use pivot tables a little bit with a littlebit more detail which is great.We also took a look at our first pivot table this was the quad core percentage.We got a very clear quick sense by using some of clicks and some of impressions and the quality coursethe roll label and we created our own formula to get a an overall an overall account health check.So we saw that we definitely need work because you know 66 percent of our impressions were coming fromlow quality score keywords of a of a of a six or below.So this was the pivot table by using some compression some of clicks and our quality score as relabelledwe were able to get an overall account health check in and this particular account we saw that we definitelyneed some work because a vast majority of our impressions are coming from low quality score keywords.We then were able to get a look at the weighted average.Take a look at our average quater score per group.In this first pivot table by using the labels which is the ADD group name some have cost an averagequality of course.We were able to see the high spending and groups like this one over here that could use some work.And then because we know that averages tend to lie.We were able to get the weighted quality score and could really start seeing with a little bit moreclarity and a little bit more accuracy which keywords which add groups can really use that work.So over here we see this is a very high spending.The highest spending and group by far with a hundred and twenty two thousand dollars spent in clickswith a five point nine five quality score and that's something that we need to work on and in fact justin the defense obviously this is a client of ours and we've gotten these qualities course way up fromwhere they started which was when we inherited the campaign which were very low in that in that youknow two to three range and a lot of these keywords are testing keywords they're new keywords whichoften start off with a four or five quality score which is working that up.But overall we're seeing exactly where we want to do some work in this account over here in this account.You know in this group even though it's a low spending ad group we want to do some more because we'reseeing a six quiet or now if it's really spending such a little bit of money $53 I probably would recommendnot spending so much time.You'd be much better off spending your time in this in these higher spending ad groups that are generatinglower than than lower impressions or lower quality scores than we would like to see.So that's definitely something that you want take a look at.So overall we definitely did a lot of very you know pretty advanced stuff we understood we took a lookat an understanding weighted averages.We took a look at understanding pivot tables how to assess the health the overall count quality scorehealth and then how to determine exactly which groups need work by using the average quality score figuringout which AGABUS spend spending the most money that have the lowest quality scores and figuring outbased on the weighted average once again with a little bit more accuracy which aggregates you startto work on.You ready learn from the previous vidos exactly how to fix quali score how to improve your quality score.And now it's just really a matter of working on these these elements working on these components andtaking your skills to the next level so.Guys thanks so much for watching.I hope you did learn a lot.This is a very crucial aspect of our campaign managing understanding quality score.And I look forward to seeing you in a couple of minutes in the next video.Talk to you guys soon.
