# 20.32 Keyword Bidding Basics- Setting Your Initial Max CPC Bids

How do Google ads fans and welcome back.In this lecture I want to try to help answer a question that I get all the time, especially aroundthis time of the course, which is how do you choose a mac CPC bid?Well, in general, how do you know what your maximum CPC bid should be?But especially how do you do it when you don't have data?How do you do it if you're building a new campaign?And it's not an easy question to answer, but I'm going to try to help walk you through it.If you had data and you should have data, and over time, this whole formula is going to change.You're going to take all the guesswork out of it.You're going to be able to easily calculate what your maximum CPC should be because you're going toknow what your conversion rates are.You're going to know what your cost per clicks are going to be.You're going to know a lot of this data.You know what your click through rate is, and you'll be able to use that to to determine what we callrevenue per click.And revenue per click is a pretty fundamental formula for you to know revenue.Per click.How much money are you generating from every click?And you can look at this, can analyze this at the ad level, you could analyze this at the campaignlevel.You could also analyze this at the at the keyword level.And in AdWords, this column or in Google ads, this column is actually looks like this conversion valueover click right.This is your revenue per click column.Let's take a look at a very basic example.Right?So let's say over the course of 30 days, you generate 30 $500 of revenue.That's revenue now, not necessarily profit, but revenue.That's your conversion value from your campaigns and let's say the total amount of clicks you received.Now, it's not the cost of the click.This is the volume of clicks was 1275 clicks.So revenue per click is a really simple formula.You take 3500, you divide it by 1275.And how much do you get?Mathematicians$2.75.This is your our PC revenue per click, $2.75.Now, you know that $2.75 is the amount of revenue generated per click.That doesn't necessarily tell you if you're profitable, that doesn't necessarily tell you what yourclick should be.It all depends on this amount of revenue.Was this profitable based on how much you actually spent in the account?But revenue per click is going to be an important formula for for you to know and for you to just sortof understand as we go along.But now let's say you don't have data.Well, there's a couple of things you could do now in order to determine what your cost per click shouldbe before you have any actual data in your account, you're going to have to come up with a couple ofestimates.And the the main estimate you're going to have to come up with and you have to figure out is going tobe what your conversion rate is going to be on your website.Now, again, this could be at the keyword level, at the campaign level, the ad level, the accountlevel.But let's take a look at this, for example, at the keyword level.So say we're or maybe an accurate level.So we're looking at rolling office chairs, right?So let's say we're dealing with an ad group.Our ad group is.Rolling chairs.And this is important for a couple of reasons, and we'll get that in a second.So what's my conversion rate?What for?What percentage of clicks are going to purchase?Now, we don't know that because we haven't run this we haven't run this ad group yet.Right?So we don't really know what our conversion rate is, but there's a couple of ways we can get some estimates.One is, do we know what our conversion rate is from organic or do we have analytics?If you know an organic conversion rate, use that.Now, if your organic conversion rate is just branded, right?So if your brand of conversion rate, if somebody looks for a rolling chairs popping or whatever yourcompany is, whatever your service is, whatever it is that you're talking about, let's say your brandand conversion rate is 6%.Take 2% off.All right.And go with an estimate of 4% for PPC.It could be less.It could be.Again, these are estimates.Ask your colleagues.Try to determine what is normal in your field.So if you're an e-commerce company, you might want to do something like 2% would be aggressive fore-com.So maybe do something like 1% or 1.5% conversion rate.And again, like the individual keywords in this ad group are going to have different conversion ratesbecause some will be exact match brought, match board, match modify, different search firms willconvert different rates.But you we have to start getting estimates.The most important thing is just to get the ball rolling get the campaigns rolling at a at a reasonablywell predicted cost per click bid.So we're not under bidding and we're not grossly over bidding.So I wouldn't recommend doing this, breaking this down at every single keyword.If you have five keywords in the account, sure, go ahead.But if you're looking at it in aggregate use, you're going to have to use rough estimates.So you can take a look at analytics, look at or and you can take a look at analytics and filter outbranded traffic and get a look at your conversion rate there.What is your sense of conversion rate based on the traffic?And if you don't even have analytics, try to get a sense of total visitors.If you don't have a full analytics set up with ecommerce tracking, how many sessions have you had?How many unique users, how many sales corroborate your offline data?Ask friends, find out the average conversion rate in your industry, let's say for a given productcategory.So let's say we come up and we say, All right, listen.We think and we predict we could reasonably predict that for a very tight group of keywords under rollingchairs, you know, not crazy broad.We're going to be doing bottom of the funnel stuff.We're going to go with a 2% conversion rate.Great.We need a couple more pieces of information.We need to know desiredROIs.And that's return on and spend what is our profit margin.Now, if you're a digital company, you're selling software.Or if you let's say you're selling software as a service, your costs, your margins are going to bemuch higher.Typically, you might be doing an 80%, 90%, 95% margin on your products.If you're an e-commerce company and your dropshipping, it might be significantly less.It might be 10%, 20%, whatever it is.So to get your desired ROI was how much money you need your campaigns to return.So for every dollar you spend on advertising, how much money do you have to earn back to break even?You need to know your margins.So say, for example, Poppins margins are 40%.So let's say that's their margin.Rather.Let's say Poppins margins are.40%.Margin.Which means they're going to need a 250% raise because you take one divided by 0.4.It gives you 250% required.ROSE That means in English.For every $1 spent on advertising, they need to get back to dollars and $0.50 in revenue in order tobreak even, because in order for them to earn a dollar in profit, they have to generate $2.50 of revenue.They earn the dollar in profit and then a dollar goes to the advertising.So a 250% return on ad spend actually is break even.No money made, no money lost.That's break even be returned to ad spend 230%.All right.So let's just call make it a little cleaner and say desired ROI was based on our margins of 40%.And if your margin is 50%, you're your desired Ross.You're breaking in.Ross is 200%.So this is really this is really not desired.You know, your desire is going to be to make money, obviously.So let's call this.Break even Rose.All right.So at a 40% margin, the break even Rose is 250%.Now, there's a third piece of the puzzle we need.We need to know.Our average.Order value.All right.So that's why I said do this at the at the at the ad group level, because rolling chairs will havea different average order value than white leather chairs.They'll have a different order value than desk accessories, pen trays versus desk lamps.So let's say again, do you know your average order value?Well, this should be relatively easy to predict.How much do your items cost and do people buy them in bulk?So I know that on average my rolling chairs cost $300 and people don't buy them in bulk.I mean, if and again, if this was a desk lamp, that might be $75.If it's pen trays, it's $7.Right.So this is very getting your cost per click varies greatly by ADD groups.But again, if you set up your aggregates well and you have these thematically related groups of averagebroken out, this should work really, really well.So our average order value is going to be 300 bucks.Maybe people will buy an average, let's say $10 worth of accessories with a desk, with a rolling chair.Let's say I know that from my historic data, so maybe they won't.But so assuming they're not, let's just go with a straight $300 average order value.Now, this number again is just a guess.If you're starting off from scratch, if you've been running campaigns for a while, your website'sbeen up for a while, you'll know exactly what your average order value is for any product segment orany category segment.And if you're a service company and you do carpet cleaning, what's your average order value?Now, again, the average order value is not profit because we're we're going to be taking that intoaccount.We're taking into our needed rows.Our breakeven rows is 230%.So don't worry if your average order value does not is not a $300 worth of profit, that's the wholepoint of this entire formula.So now we want to figure out, based on our conversion rate, based on our breakeven rates and basedon our average order value, knowing these three things, how do we determine a cost per click?So I'm going to show you a formula to figure that out.So the formula is as follows Let's make a separation here.So you're going to take your.Average order value.All right.You should write this down and save this.You're going to divide that by your race, your breakeven rose, and then you're going to multiply thatby your conversion rate.This is how you get a starting EPC from.These three factors conversion rate, break, even raise and average order value.Now, there's a few different ways you can get here.You can get to you could determine max EPS using a few different formulas and some different some differentmetrics.But this, in my opinion, is the one that will give you the most accuracy without any data, becauseyou only need to guess at one thing.You only need you only need to guess at conversion rate.You could get there by looking at estimated cost per click also, but cost per click is such a widevariance and it gets messy.Break even.Our OS is easy as long as you know your profit margins, average order value is even easier becauseyou should know what your average order value is going to be.So here, let's plug this stuff in and you guys always could check me on the math.So our average order value 300 bucks.Divided by our break even return on ad spend to 50 equals 1.2.Right.1.2 multiplied by 2%.Conversion rate.2.4.All right.That is your breakeven max.EPC click max EPC bit.$2.40.It's beautiful.It's elegant.And it works.All right.Now we can talk about this in English a little bit to.Make this into some sort of logical structure.So what this is saying is.$2.40.At a 2% conversion rate.A 1% conversion rate means one in every 100 clicks will lead to a sale.A 2% conversion rate means one.In 50 clicks will lead to a sale.Right.One in 50 clicks will lead to a sale.You could do this mathematically by taking 2.4 to make sure we're right.Right.So 2.4 divided by 0.02.Right.2.4 divided by 0.02 equals.You guys doing your math, it equals 120.All right.So that means I'm going to have to spend $120 and 2.4 times 50 is also 120.All right.So we know our math works out.So 2.4 divided by 2% equals $130.What that means is that in an English, again, because you need to understand the formulas, you needto understand how to explain this in English.That means that.It will take.On average.That's big and important.It will take on average $120 in clicks.To generate.$300 in revenue.Which is great, but how great is it?Well, simple enough.We're going to take 300, which is $300 in revenue.Divide it by 120.Right.And that's going to give us 2.5 our 250% conversion rate that we need to get.So, again, this is everything that you need to understand to get to a breakeven.Cost per click bid.Now.Now you understand the formulas, you understand the English, right?So you can explain this to your client or you can look at this for your own campaigns at $2 and 40%at $2.40 a click.If this is right, if my average order value is 300 and my margins are 40% and my conversion rate isgoing to be 2%, then $2.40 will break even.I won't lose money.I won't get money.But if I get clicks for $2, I'll be making money.If I get clicks for $2.60, I'll be losing money.I'll be losing $0.20 on every single click again if these values were correct, because once more timea quick review, you take your average order value, which was 300, you divide that by 250, whichis your desired way.As you get 1.2, you multiply that 1.2 by a 2% conversion rate that gives you 2.4 $2.40.Breaking that down in English, a 2% conversion rate means one in 50 clicks will convert into one $300sale, which means 50 clicks times multiplied by $2.40 gives me 120.That means that you need to spend on average $120 to generate a sale.How much is a sale?$300 in revenue.What's your profit margin?40% of that.Which means you take the and you take the $300 divided by $120 of cost.That gives you a 2.5%, 250% break even point.You could also look at it one more way by doing 300 right, I earn $300 and I have a 40% margin multiplyby point by 0.4.That also equals, you guessed it, 120, which means that $120, which I which I profited this I mycompany at a 40% margin my company earns.$120 out of every $300, which is the same thing as saying I earn $0.40 on every $1, right?I also earn $180 out of every $300.But guess what?Google now is going to charge me $180 for my for my $52 and 40 cent clicks, which then is a zero remainder,which is why this is break even.This is break even.And, you know, you also bought a customer and we haven't gotten to lifetime value yet and break evenas good, which is why I want to go with break even.You should set your original max bids at break even because if you could launch a Google ads accountbreaking even, that's good.That's better than most people.And you bought a customer.The next time the customer is going to buy from you, the next thing that customer is going to callyou up for a service.The next day that customer is going to call you up for whatever it is.You're going to be getting that revenue without having to spend any more money, getting the client,hopefully repeat customers, word of mouth, referrals, all that stuff is very valuable.We haven't even touched upon that.We haven't brought that into the calculation at all.This is just some very basic fundamental components of determining a profitable cost per click bid ora break even cost per click bid.Go for that.If your client says Absolutely not, we have to make a profit, so then say that you need a 300% return.All right, so then you take 300 divided by 300 OC, and obviously that's one that means my max bidis two.If my conversion rate is 2% and if things change and hey, you could get your conversion rate up to4%, right?Then in this 300 by 300 is one times four.I could have a $4 cost per click bid to break even or or rather to be profitable.To be profitable because now we bumped from 250 to 300.But again, if my strongest recommendation, my my best advice is to create the campaigns to to workon your max EPC bid calculations at a break even ROI.So you do need to know those three things.You need to know your average order value your break even ROI was desired Ros it could be and your predictedconversion rate and be conservative.So if you think you're going to get a 3% use plug in 2% of the formula if you think you're going toget 2.5 plug in 1.75 in the formula, use a calculator and all that, all these numbers will work perfectlyagain.Average order value divided by rows multiplied by your conversion rate.Do this at the if you've built your campaign right and you follow all the steps, you should be ableto do this at the ad group level.You can do it at the keyword level.You could even do it at the campaign level.But within any campaign you're likely, unless your campaign is targeting the same service just fordifferent locations and and the predicted conversion rates the same in the order value values the same,then do it at the campaign level and set a default campaign level bid.If you can do it, the ad group set a set of default ad group level bid and then once you have data,then you'll be able to start modifying your bids at the individual keyword level.And of course, I know this is quick.We're going to run through all of this again in a future lecture, but this is actually the end of keywords.I wanted to just I wanted to go through this so you guys could have a good sense of of.How to determine a maximum CPC bid at the keyword level I could create.What I'll try to do is create an Excel template for you guys to use and I can share that with you thatjust plugs this formula in average order value divided by desired ROI multiplied by conversion rateto give you a break, even CPC bid and you could duplicate that formula and use it for yourself.But it's good to memorize it.It's good to know it on your own.It makes you a more well rounded practitioner of Google.AD So with that, this concludes our exciting section on keywords, understanding keywords.I really appreciate you coming along with me for the ride this long into it and we're just getting startedthough.There's so much more exciting things they had.There's conversion tracking, phone call tracking, designing ads.Auditing accounts.Analyzing quality score.Expanding your account.Refining your campaigns.Lots of cool stuff ahead.So I look forward to seeing you guys in the very next lecture where we're going to start talking aboutthe wonderful dynamics of the Google ads auction, how quality score works, how relevancy works, andhow your actual cost per click is determined.We've been talking about maximum CPC the most you're willing to pay, but that's not what you actuallypay.How does Google calculate your actual CPC bid?It's an exciting topic and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon.The very next lecture.
