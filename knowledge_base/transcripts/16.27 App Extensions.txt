# 16.27 App Extensions

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.Let's briefly talk about app extensions and they will be relevant to a small percentage of you thatare advertising apps.If you're advertising an app and you're trying to get app downloads, you could use app extensions todo so, to send clicks on the app extension directly to the app and the app store.Again, this is different, similar to how call extensions differ from call only campaigns.This is not the same thing as an app campaign.There are campaign types in Google ads that are specifically designed to advertise and promote appsin the App Store.But the app extension will offer the app with the headline description that might go to a landing page.If somebody wants to directly download the app and again, a click on an app extension will cost thesame as a click on a headline.So to add app extensions, I don't have any separate slides for this one.It's pretty straightforward and it's not relevant to most of us.You open up the app extension's window, select new app extension, and you select whether or not whetherthis is an Android app or an iOS app.And of course, you could add an app extension for both.So say this is an iOS app.We would look up that name of that app in the app store.So if you start typing in an app and I was I was just messing around with this app the other day, soI would click the app, my link text could be downloaded now or visit the App Store or whatever it mightbe.It defaults to download.Now I could exclude tablets if I'd like to.I could add tracking templates and I could add advanced options such as Start and Start and end dates.By now this is very familiar to you and specific scheduling.And of course I don't have the option to prefer this on mobile because of course this is a mobile specificextension.So that's what app extensions do.Again, if you're if you're downloading if you're promoting the downloads of your app, then this isgreat.And this is also something then you should also be considering app campaigns.But if the secondary objective is to download an app and you're sending people to a landing page andyou just also offer an app, then this is a great place to potentially expand the size of your ad andalso give the user that option.Do you want to visit our site or do you want to visit our app and you use the app?Download charge the same way as a click.Because we're not going to be running that.I'll just click cancel and then we're going to continue on without any app extension.In the next lecture, we'll talk about message extensions.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in that lecture.Cheers from now.
