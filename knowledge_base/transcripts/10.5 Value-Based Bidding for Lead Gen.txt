# 10.5 Value-Based Bidding for Lead Gen

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about value based bidding for lead gen.So there's two key things here.Just to recap.Value based bidding and lead gen.Value based bidding contrasts with manual bidding.Manual bidding means that you're setting the individual max.CPC bids for every single keyword and search term in your account.Manual bidding says.I'm going to tell you, Google how much I'm willing to pay every single time an individual searchesthis keyword or some variation of this keyword.Remember we talked about match types.So a keyword could trigger all different types of search terms.But in essence, manual bidding means I'm going to only bid this amount based on the search term itself.So I'm not bidding based on the value of the customer.I'm bidding on how good I think a certain keyword is.And we talked at the main issue with manual bidding is that there's a customer behind every keyword.So you know, say say we're selling go back to to fountain pens, say I'm selling fountain pens.That's my website.Or we're going to talk about lead gen.So I'm a HVAC repair company and I'm generating leads for HVAC service calls.Somebody might search for install a new generator.Now I might think that's a good keyword, but in essence, a thousand different people could go to Googleand search for that exact same keyword.And those thousand people are not created equal.Those thousand people represent different stages of the buying cycle, a different likelihood to actuallyfill out a form today on your site.Different quality of lead.So value based bidding means we're going to we're going to take a step back from setting individualCPC bids.How much we're willing to pay for that.Click based on the keyword.And we're going to tell Google, I want you to figure out how much to bid based on how valuable youthink this customer is to my business.So of course it's better, right?Nobody really cares about what we pay per click.We care about what we pay for a customer.We care about the quality of leads.We care about the revenue and the profit we're generating.So in theory, we should always be using value based bidding, right?In theory, value based bidding 100% of the times is better.However, that's not the reality.Value based bidding is a program that Google is refining over time, so it's not a perfect system.And Google sometimes gets it wrong.They sometimes don't have a great model for predicting the value of a specific customer.And there are instances still where manual bidding is more effective.When you're setting a bid based on the quality of a keyword or the quality of a search term and ignoringthe underlying customer behind it?Of course, you can use certain levers and tools within Google like demographics and audience targeting,time of day adjustments, device adjustments to, I would say, moderate the bids a little bit basedon what we think about the customer.However, when you're using value based bidding, you're getting access to a whole.We talked about this in a previous lecture.Thousands of signals that Google themselves have access to that we do not have access to.So as a as a high level strategic recap, it's always best to try to make value based bidding work intoday's modern campaign setup.I would say 7 to 8 times out of ten, value based bidding strategies are going to be much more effectivefor your campaigns.So now we're going to talk about strategies for how to apply and how to choose the right value basedbidding for lead gen campaigns.And again, lead gen Contrasts really with e-commerce.So at a high level, if your website has a checkout and you're selling goods off your site, peoplecould enter their credit card, they could buy something, whether it's a digital, physical good,or even if it's a ticket to a concert, it's a ticket to an event that's going to be e-commerce.If your main conversion action is a form submission, a phone call, a download of a of a white paperor an e-book, that's what we call lead gen.Generating leads.You haven't had a revenue action yet.There needs to be additional follow up from a sales team in order to generate revenue.Very simple example.I run the Adventure Academy.That's an e-commerce site.People come, they purchase training content.It's not physical goods, it's digital goods.But that's e-commerce because we're the revenue generating event is taking place online.Whereas I also run Adventure Media.That's an agency we help advertisers throughout the world.Brands big and small.Optimize and enhance their campaigns.That's lead gen, because the first step that we'd be tracking from a digital campaign is a form submissionor a phone call.And then one of our sales team has to call them back, set a meeting, do an audit, prepare a proposal.There's a number of steps that need to take place before an invoice gets sent, before a deal is closed,before a contract is signed.So strategy is a little bit different, but let's get into it.The first thing we want to sort of understand is that not all conversions are created equal okay.So a reminder conversions are any action that you decide to track as a meaningful event.Now with e-commerce your typical conversion is going to be a checkout.So that's a meaningful event because there's some revenue associated with it.However, with lead gen, your most meaningful conversion will probably be a form submission or a phonecall.And there's no clear revenue target or there's no clear revenue figure that we might attach to thatevent.So smart bidding strategies that bid towards values.Understand the difference in value of each conversion when optimizing conversion only strategies.Treat all conversions equally when trying to maximize their volume under a given target budget.Now contrast that with manual bidding, which treats all clicks equally under a given CPC with no considerationof conversions in the auction.Okay, so you might have a number of different conversions in your account setup, right?You might be tracking a phone call.You might be tracking a form submission.You might be tracking a view of a key page.So if you're looking at conversion only smart strategies right.Like maximize conversions maximize conversions is one of the the automated bid bidding strategies,the smart bidding strategies that we discussed.It's going to look at all of those conversion actions when optimizing your campaigns.It's going to try to get as many or whatever mix they can for the best, for the best mix they can.Of those conversions for your budget.So that's something to be careful of.If you're using a if you're in Legion and you're using a, um, maximize conversions bidding strategy.One of the key considerations is to look at return revenue and profit when you're configuring smartbidding.So we tend to see we've seen 1,515% increase in conversion value when moving from target CPA to targetreturn on ad spend.Now to get things in perspective, of course target CPA and target return on ad spend are the idealconversion actions that you're going to want to configure, because those are conversion actions thatare those are those are bidding strategies rather That incorporate how much money you're actually making.So target CPA is telling Google, here's how much I want to get form submissions for target return onad spend is how much money I want to earn in profit on every conversion, but it's not so obvious howto apply or how to who how to attach a dollar amount to a form submission.If you're in lead gen and we're going to in a few slides, get back to that very question how to attachhow to apply values to these different stages.But first let's discuss some of the ins and outs of these different bidding strategies as they applyto lead gen.So you have cost based bidding and value based bidding, right?So cost based bidding is a target CPA bid strategy.I'm looking for a target cost per let's call it form submission since we're talking about lead gen.And then I have value based bidding, which is target return on ad spend.So on the left hand side, under cost.Cost based bidding.I know that if if my CPA is if my CPA increases to a certain amount, I'm not going to bid.I'm not going to bid for those conversions because it's not worth it's not worth bidding on those conversionsbecause I'm looking for a specific target CPA, but it ignores the potential value.It ignores the potential value of those conversions.That might be that's that's part of why cost based bidding, just using a target CPA with lead gen mightbe problematic, because it's treating every single form submission as equal.Rather, on the right hand side.The bid adjusts with the value.So if Google sees a form submission from a person who Google understands might be my top tier customer,right?It has a let's call it a $1,000 value.Google is going to increase the bid accordingly, and maybe Google is going to bid $9 to generate thatclick to generate that traffic.But if Google sees on the, you know, as the value of the predicted value of the lead drops, and maybethis is a $250 opportunity for me, then Google is going to bid less.And that's that.That I would say modulation of bid is unique to value based bidding.It'll go up and down based on Google's predicted value.Now, again, the same way we said that, that smart bidding seems to be a better option always thanmanual bidding.But there were instances where manual bidding still is going to be more effective.It's the same thing here.Value based bidding obviously makes more sense if it's working.So if Google has enough data on your customers from your CRM.And we'll get we'll get into closing the feedback loop in a moment.But when Google has enough customers, or they have enough data to understand which clicks are mostlikely to fill out a form, and which forms are most likely to be the most valuable customers.Let's go back to an example you have.Let's let's talk about an HVAC campaign.So generator installs could be $20,000 in a larger project.It could be $1,000 in a smaller project.So say Google understands that this person is a landlord who owns multiple multifamily units.Now they might be searching the same words generator install as an individual who's looking for thesmallest possible generator on the market.So now you might be talking about a $5,000 opportunity versus a $100,000 opportunity.Google will have that.We if you're managing your campaigns, there's no way for you to say adjust the bids based on whetheror not somebody owns multiple buildings.But Google is going to have those signals.Google is going to understand this person.Their income.They have credit card data.They have they have thousands of data points on individuals.So Google is going to say, oh, you're looking for a 200% return on ad spend.Well, this opportunity is we predict this opportunity is X value.We predict the likelihood for them to convert is y.So we're going to bid $9 whereas the same exact keyword, the same exact search term.Google might only bid $2 because they're going to say, okay, this is an individual who's never madea large purchase before.Um, they're recent homeowner.They're filling out forms on multiple sites.They take a long time to convert.So a bid $1, that's a better system if Google gets that stuff right.But Google doesn't always get that right.Sometimes Google doesn't have enough data to optimize and to accurately predict which opportunitiesare higher or lower value.In those cases, you could then revert back to a cost based bidding tcpa where you say, look, youknow your data, you have a wide range of value in your form.Submissions.You just want to get form submissions for $50 or $100 and you're happy.And yeah, there'll be a variance.Some form submissions are going to be like fantastic.Other form submissions are going to be a losing proposition, but it's sort of your average based onyour close rates and based on what you know about your based on what you know about your, your youryour revenue, your lifetime revenue from a closed deal.So when you don't have enough data, you go to a cost based bidding structure where you tell Google,just give me these forms for X amount of dollars.But the goal is to gain is to aim where the goal is to get to a point where you can, um, where youcan get enough data to use value based bidding appropriately, because then your campaigns become muchmore dynamic.Now, what about multiple conversions in an auction?Okay.So you have you have multiple conversion actions set up for example.So let's say you have a conversion action for capturing a lead.Say you have a conversion action for a qualified lead.And let's say you have a a another action for a lead sold or a lead closed.So value based strategies will also ensure that bids reflect conversion weights if they can be one inthe same auction.Okay.So this is an important, um, additional component to why a target return on ad spend a value basedstrategy could be more effective.So for example, target return on ad spend and max conversion value.Those are both value based strategies.So you might you could you can apply you can apply a value to those strategies to each to each individualconversion action.So you might say um for lead capture, for capturing a lead, for getting a form submission.That's a $5 value for qualifying a lead.That's a $20 value for closing a deal.It's $150 value in this instance.But however, Google understands that if if I can't win, if I can't get all all these conversion actionsin the same auction, Google is going to actually take out the value of a conversion action that isnot going to likely achieve that conversion action.So target return on ad spend strategy understands that, hey, there's a there's a big variance here.There's a big variance between $5 which I'm attempting to to achieve and $150.So there's an over six times difference in value.Google's going to adjust the the the bids to maximize that value.So Google's going to say okay, we're not going to necessarily look at um a a lead sold or a lead closedvalue when implementing bids in let's say auction number three, which is just any given search termtriggering Triggering adds.It says okay, there's there's a maximum potential value here of $25 in a different auction.If Google feels that this is a remarketing campaign or it's lower down in the funnel, or here's anopportunity where we could actually close this deal and we could actually achieve the third conversionaction, then Google is going to say, okay, maybe it's $155 of total value here.So we're going to bid accordingly.Whereas with conversion only strategies, you're dealing with the same number of conversions becauseyou're trying to target a volume of conversions, you're trying to target, you're trying to targeta as many conversions for a set price.So you have your $50, for example, target CPA bid, you have a daily budget.So if your daily budget is $100 for easy math and you can get two conversions a day, and in eitherof these auctions, Google's just looking at a at a number of potential conversions.So the same way in auction three, you have two potential conversions on the table in Google system.In auction four, you also have two potential conversions on the table.However, the value is drastically different.In one case, the potential value on the table of this click in Google's algorithms is $155, and inthe other case, it's $25.So you would want to bid accordingly.You would want to adjust those bids again.The key thing to remember here is that a value based strategy is almost always, if not always, betterin theory, because you're bidding the right amount for the right customer.Think about your business, right if you're in lead gen, or think about any lead gen business justas a as a as an example.You treat your best customers better, right?So if I have a customer who's generating $100,000 a year in value in revenue, and I have a customerwho's who's generating $10,000 a year in revenue, I have $100,000 customer and I have $10,000 customer.I like them both.I want to give them both great service.I want them both to be really happy, and I want them to get what they're paying for.However, I cannot afford to invest the same amount of money in resources and expenses to service boththose leads.For example, if I invest $10,000 a year in expenses, I'm still making $90,000 profit on the firstclient if I make.If I invest $10,000 in expenses in employee and overhead, etc., then I'm making $0 in profit on thesecond client.So the same.So traffic acquisition costs.What I'm bidding to generate that opportunity is no different than how I would approach servicing thatopportunity had they been a closed deal.So value based bidding just means that it means that, look, not all clients, not all customers arecreated equal.Now, if your if in your business, you have an extremely standardized service offering and within acouple dollars or a couple percentage points, all of your customers generate the same amount of lifetimerevenue, then conversion only strategies target CPA and Max conversions could work really, reallywell.But if your If you're if you're like most lead gen businesses where there's a pretty wide range of potential,um, values of potential revenue actions and revenue levels per client or per customer, then you wantto aim for that value based strategy.And again, it's it's always better in theory, unless in reality Google is not optimizing well enough.And Google doesn't really yet understand which potential clicks, which potential individuals do representyour best possible customers.And then things could get wonky.You could be overpaying for low quality opportunities and so and not bidding aggressively enough onhigh quality opportunities and the antidote.The way to overcome that issue is more data and more time.If you're tracking your conversions properly over time, Google is going to get better at value basedstrategies, and your value based bidding strategies will improve.Okay, so going back to the original question we asked about how do we assign values for lead gen.So Google actually makes a great tool.You're going to use the Google Ads conversion value calculator to determine the value per lead in differentstages of the funnel.And we'll we'll send you I'm sorry.We'll send you that link in the description of this lecture so you could access that.Um, you could access that calculator.So you could set up your funnel.So in this image over here we have an example.You have an Mql.You have a marketing qualified lead.Then 30% conversion rate to a sales qualified lead, 40% conversion rate to a customer.And you put in your average conversion value of a customer.So this is the average amount.This is the average amount that you would assign to a deal.Now this is going to be good if you're using or this is going to be actually necessary if you're usinga target CPA or maximize conversion volume if you're if you're bidding on conversions because you stillhave to find that average because you need to get back to telling Google, I'm not looking at revenue,I'm not looking at margin.I'm not looking at value.I'm looking at conversions.I want to get as many conversions as I can at $400 or whatever it may be.But the way to get to that $400 and the way to tell Google, um, how many conversions are actuallyclosing, you need to you need to apply a bid, you need to apply a value to that mql and then applya value to that SQL.And that all works backwards through understanding your average customer conversion value.That could be your average lifetime value and your conversion rates at each step of the funnel.And Google will calculate that number.What your target CPA for your first step, if that's an mql or a form submission, what what it shouldbe.So that's a really good tool for that's a really good tool when you're setting up, um, Conversionbased smart bidding strategies for lead gen.To set your expectations straight, we want to understand what to expect with value based bidding.Okay, so number one, in the beginning the campaign is going to experiment with different strategiesand you're likely going to have a decrease in conversions.This is not something to be really afraid of.It's not something to freak out about.In time.Performance will even out.Cost per acquisition can likely increase when you switch from.If you're running a campaign that's been running on manual bidding for a long time, and then you switchto value based bidding in the beginning, your cost per acquisition is going to go up.Performance might become a little bit destabilized.Number three, you're going to have to dynamically update values based on offline conversion rates asthey change.So if you're if you're generating in-store sales And you're seeing in your own CRM data that's indicating,oh, I have a higher conversion rate.I have a lower conversion rate.Then you need to update, go back into Google and update the values of specific conversions.As you see those conversion rates change.However, most importantly, two things that are very important.The quality of your conversion should increase with value based bidding.Okay, so you might get fewer actual form submissions, but Google over time is going to get betterat generating better quality form submissions, better quality opportunities for you as you move intovalue based bidding.Why?Because value based bidding now means I have a range of quality in my potential client base.Not every opportunity is equal.One opportunity might represent $20,000 of lifetime value.Another opportunity might represent $100,000 of lifetime value.So when I'm using value based bidding, whether it's target Roas or maximize conversion value.I'm instructing Google to get me margin.So Google is going to try to go after those higher quality people by understanding who those higherquality opportunities are.And lastly, a slow and methodical testing approach do not give up on value based bidding.I've said this before.I'll say it again.The number one reason I see campaigns fail is because people shut off their campaigns too quickly.Moving into value based bidding is tough.You're sort of ceding a certain degree of control.It's uncomfortable.Um, but.If you understand the theories that we've discussed, if you understand what's happening beneath thesurface, if you're understanding all the different signals that Google is accessing, and you alsofundamentally understand that Google wants you to make as much money as possible, they do, then itshould encourage you to stick with it.I'm not suggesting you go into debt.I'm not suggesting you spend money recklessly, but I'm suggesting that you look at this as an expenseand the transition into target or value based bidding or target CPA bidding, smart bidding in general,if you look at this transition and you whether it's yourself or your company, you're pitching clients,you look at it as an investment in research and development.Sometimes I compare it to like hiring a web developer, web developer for a new website.Companies will spend 30, 50, $200,000 on a new website.Can they tie any specific revenue figure to that website?No, it's new design.It's like, well, we need to do market research.We have to do mood boards.We have to do copywriting.All these things are like could be looked at as could be looked at as fixed costs that aren't directlyimpacting revenue.But yet you know that if I invest this 100 grand in the new website, over time, I'm going to get betterquality leads and I'm going to have a better online presence.And fine.Great.It's true.I'm not.I'm all I'm all in for investing in good, highly functioning websites, highly functioning websites.But we have an attitude that every day when we're looking at Google, there should be a return.But you have to look at the transition into value based bidding, like hiring a web developer.There's going to be a period of time where I'm just paying to build a foundation.I'm paying to build a service, I'm paying to build a structure.And then at some point in time, that structure is actually going to be able to be providing value.What to expect with value based bidding.Step one you have to allocate value.Okay.Like that's if you're not if you're not taking the time to allocate value to the leads you get.And value means a revenue figure, you're converting your value based bidding is going to fall apart.So you want to allocate from Salesforce.Call rail any internal database, Google Sheets.You could use Zapier to send information.Um, back into Google, you could.Salesforce.Salesforce.Callrail.Um.HubSpot.Any of the major CRMs will have a natural or a native integration with Google, but you have to assignthose values.Allow Google 2 to 4 weeks to gather value data depending on conversion data volume.Okay, so 2 to 4 weeks is the minimum that you have to let these campaigns sit and gather data.If you're using maximize conversions as your bidding strategy where you want to get the most amountof conversions, the algorithm is going to be disregarding the value data until you migrate to a valuebased bidding strategy.So that's one of the things that we that we that we had mentioned maximize conversions, just tellstells tells Google.Look at the number of actual triggers for these conversion actions.And whatever value data you have is going to be ignored until you migrate to a value based bidding strategylike target return on ad spend.However, it is still unbelievably important to assign values because if your goal is to eventuallymigrate, if this is a new campaign, if it's a brand new campaign, we might start.You might want to start with a maximize conversion bidding strategy, but you're going to know in fourto 6 or 8 weeks from now, I want to migrate to a value based bidding strategy.I want to migrate to a target return on ad spend strategy.So make sure you have your values set at the conversion level in your Google Ads account.So when it's time to migrate, Google is going to actually have value data to to work from.This is a personal thing.Number three determine the best campaign to test in based on your volume and risk tolerance.So we're talking about a transition right.So you might have ten 1520 different campaigns in an account.Um and you want to begin testing value based bidding strategies.You want to start moving away from manual.Well I don't know if I would go into the highest performing campaign that's generating 75% of the company'sprofits and start messing around with bidding strategies there.Maybe I would use an experiment to test 20, 30% of the traffic, or I would take middle mid groundcampaigns where where?If that campaign started doing really poorly tomorrow, it would not have dramatically negative consequences.Number four, evaluate performance based bidding strategies on higher offline conversion rates fromindividual campaigns and or comparison of conversion value before and after migration.Okay, so so if you want to get a sense of whether or not value based bidding strategies are working.One is you really want to make sure you're understanding your date ranges.Okay.So I'm going to test for the next four weeks.And then we're going to analyze how performance was these four weeks before the other four weeks.Um, but look at conversion rates from individual campaigns.So even if you don't have a completely closed feedback loop between Salesforce or HubSpot or your CRMback into Google, you could look at leads that you've generated in your CRM and get a sense, did Iclose more schools into closed opportunities.Did more schools turn into Mqls?Because one of the best things, one of the main benefits you're going to get from value based biddingis not necessarily a higher volume of conversions.What you're going to get is a higher quality of lead.And how do you assess quality?Of course, you can look at money in the bank, but you could also look at some intermediary steps inyour pipeline.Did I close more mqls into Sqls?Did I did more mqls.Turn into Sqls.Did more sqls turn into leads?What is the average deal size over the last eight weeks compared to the eight weeks prior?Um, so so those are again worthwhile steps to to consider as you think through value based bidding.So now now that we can check off value based bidding from our list, we should have a good understandingof of the value based bidding options, the underlying theory.Um, let's walk through an example search campaign setup.
