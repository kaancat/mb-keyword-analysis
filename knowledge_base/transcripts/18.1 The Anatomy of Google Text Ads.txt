# 18.1 The Anatomy of Google Text Ads

How do you lads fans and welcome back to this new section on writing Killer Ads.We really should have a celebratory drink together because we've made it quite far.We're not even close to anywhere near the end of the course.But we should we should feel pretty good about coming as far as you've come.And I think you do know a lot more about Google ads than you did a few hours ago.And you probably know a lot more about Google ads than most people that you're working with.And I think you're already getting into the point where your skills are going to be seriously valuable.But this section is all about writing ads, and there's a lot to understand about Google ads.And Google ads has changed their text ads and the formats of their text ads a lot over time.When I started in this business, it was one headline with with 20 characters, and then it went totwo headlines.Then it went to more characters and expanded text ads and then multiple headlines.There's all different sorts of things you could do.And we're going to start off I'm going to teach you about the anatomy of your basic expanded text adin Google ads.They're just called text ads.Now, I still refer to them as expanded text ads because they're significantly expanded on what we usedto have.But there's also other formats of text ads, mainly dynamic text ads, which are in beta right now.But I want to show you what those are as well, and I'll show you those at a future lecture in the course.But first, let's start off with the anatomy of the basic text ad, which you're going to be using.Most commonly.You get two headlines, each headline shows up at the top, and each headline is a maximum of 30 characters.They're split up into two headlines, and they're usually split up with either a pipe between the twoheadlines or a dash between the two headlines.And when you create that ad in Google ads, you'll actually see that as a preview.It's usually this pipe symbol between between the two headlines.Beneath that, you have this little ad indicator, which is a tiny little green box with a well, it'sa transparent background with a green outline that indicates that this is an ad.And then you have your display URL with two different subdirectory paths.You have 15 characters per path and the display level character limit changes.If you have a long displayed URL, you could request a review.I'm going to teach you how to request a review, but you try to keep it within 15 to 20 characters forthat.Display your URL.I get a lot of clients that ask us.They know we take on their account.We're running ads and they call us frantic, they say.We looked for our ads.We saw an ad and there's there's a URL on the page.We don't even have that landing page on our site.We don't have a page like that.And I said, calm down, you just play oral is just your display.Your RL doesn't actually mean the website or landing page that a person is going to.So for example, your final URL, which is what you were going to, your final URL doesn't ever appearin the actual ad to a user.You put a final URL in, which is where a person should wind up.If they do click your ad, you have your actual URL or final URL with with potentially your trackingtemplate information appended to it if that's the case.But your display URL could be a cleaner version of a final URL.So for example, let's say we're talking about office chairs and we're talking about and we're, we'redoing rolling office chairs.So if I were to find that page on Poppins website, it might be like rolling question mark, chairsslash search equals whatever, right?It might be this really weird search results URL to get me to a page that just has rolling office chairs.So what I could do for my display URL is I could write, I could say pop in dot com for my route URLand I could have, let's say, chairs as my first path rolling.Right, which gives the user a very clear indication that they're going to the right page.So if a person does take a look at this display URL.Oh yeah, that's actually a page that I like to go to so they don't have to see this big, messy thing,what this this long URL, which I would copy from the menu bar or the browser, the browser addressbar in my browser.That's what goes here in the final URL.That's the actual page, that's that long, ugly looking URL.And then you could clean it up, make it nice, and use this as part of your marketing.And interestingly enough, I wasn't going to cover this, but we've seen time and time again that puttingpads that are relevant to the search term in the keyword, in your in your keywords, in your pads.So if I, if I have keywords like office chairs, rolling chairs, right?And I have that in my path, quality score goes up.So it does affect quality score click, the rate will go up.And it's a really smart way to use this.Well you now have to 90 character descriptions we're going to talk about in the next couple of lectureswhat to use descriptions for, what to use headlines for some best practices, so on and so forth.But your description gives you each 90 characters.Now, don't expect both descriptions to show up together.They almost always don't.Sometimes you'll get and there's no way to control it necessarily.So you have to have each description view it as its own little micro ad, because you're only goingto, in most cases, get your first description and sometimes have your second description.Usually if you're only when you get only one of your descriptions to show with your ad, you alwayshave at least one of them showing you'll never have an ad with just your headline.You always get the description.But if a description only if only your if only one description shows, it will usually be your number,your first description.So make this your key selling point.Make this your key value proposition.Make sure in description one, you're telling a person why they should click on your ad today, why,why they should buy from you, and then additional supporting information could go in description too.Now, again, this is not an AB test.You're not testing description two against description one, there are other tools and vehicles thatwill use in Google ads to test different ad headlines, to test different descriptions, to test adsagainst each other.Absolutely.But your two descriptions in an ad is not meant as an AB test.You'll have your description one, and sometimes you'll also have description two and have a much largerad beneath your second description is all your different extensions.So if you have location extensions, you have promotion extensions, you have price extensions, youhave location extensions, you have an app extension.Maybe you might have a call extension.You have your call outs across here.And we know all about ad extensions because you cover them in enormous detail.So anyway, this is the anatomy of a Google ads, expanded text ads, otherwise known as text ads.This is the ad form that you're going to be really using the most consistently, the most commonly used.I'm also going to show you later on what dynamic expanded text ads look like.But now that you're familiar with the different components, different pieces of the text ad, let'stalk about some compliance with Google ads, best practices of Google ads and some psychological principleswith writing effective Google ads.I'm going to show you a case study and let's get to it.I love this stuff.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon and the very next lecture.
