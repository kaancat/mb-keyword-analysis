# 21.4 How To Navigate Between Ad Groups, Keywords and Ads Within A Campaign

All right.So here we are.Welcome back.And we have added all our groups.And if you could see down here we have 18 add groups and each group is really well put together withspecific keywords for each group.If we wanted to see all the keywords in this entire campaign remember that can't member the accounthierarchy.We have a count campaign ad group and inside add groups or ads and keywords if we wanted to see allthe keywords in the entire campaign.So all the key words that are in all these groups from the campaigns view which we're in now as we seeit in bold from the campaigns view we can navigate directly to keywords.If we go directly to keywords we then get a view of all the keywords in the entire campaign.And if you go to the bottom it shows that we're showing one to 50 of 215 keywords.OK.So this view will give you a sense of all the keywords and all the data for the keywords in the entirecampaign.If we wanted to see keywords for only an individual AG group there's a couple of ways we could do that.One is just to click the Add group name from the left hand menu.Or we could also click the name of the ad group that appears in the ad column next to that keyword.So rolling desk here is our cue word and afterwards is telling us that it's in the rolling AD groupand if I click rolling I'll then be shown just the key words in my rolling AD group which is 11.So we have 11 key words in each group.And I could also go ahead and go to mesh by clicking on the mesh group and taking a look at the datathere.And I can go to a conference at any time if I wanted to go back to my campaign view.I could either once again click on all campaigns or just click on this campaign.OK so if I click over here.I then have the ability to go back to my ad groups and from my groups once again I can navigate to keywordsand the same thing is true for ads.OK so if I'm in my campaign view I'm selected at the campaign level I can go see ads and this is showingme all the ads in this entire campaign.And the same thing holds true that held true for keywords if I want to see just the ads in this specificgroup I could either navigate to that ad group using the left hand menu or click on the AD group nextto the actual text that's what I want to see just the ads in our modern ad group I just click on motter.And I'm just showing that one ad we have in that ad group.OK so the key words and ads have the same navigational elements.Once you're inside a campaign.So once again I'm going to go back to my campaign view back to my ad group's view from where we started.And I see all my groups right here and keep in mind the green arrow the green circle indicates thatthese are all enabled and that holds true for key words as well if I go to my keywords I see the greencircle.All unable to go on and talk about pausing cue words pausing and Rupes pausing campaigns in a minutebut the next thing you want to do at this point.We created our first campaign.It's really well structured and keep in mind it's very very important to remember why we structuredour accounts like this because this is really where the theory comes into play.This is really how you understand.This is the core of creating successful and profitable campaigns is really understanding the structuralcomponents.We took the campaign level and said this campaign is going to talk about desk chairs and office chairs.So this campaign will just be focusing on keywords officers gestures anything related to chairs.We then said It's not good enough to just create one group for all desk chairs because there's a lotof different types of desk chairs a person might look for person to go to Google and look for a leatherdesk chair or an executive desk chair or a colorful desk chair where rolling desk chair and while wecould have just created one group for all those keywords and our ad techs could have been somethinglike you know great selection of office chairs and that I'm not saying that would have been bad butif we want to really beat our competition and we want to do better than them and get cheaper cost perclick and get better quality traffic and convert more and make more sales.We need to segment things out so we could talk specifically to the customer as if we're standing rightin front of them answering their question.So the way we set it up if somebody looks on Google and here's our keywords for a rolling desk chairright here's the key we're rolling.If somebody puts in a query rolling just here is on sale.The ad they're going to see and it's go to the ads tab his rolling desk chairs wheels that work popand forward last rolling gestures.It's as if we responded to their exact question and the same thing is true for conference conferenceseating.Is the ad if somebody looks for a padded padded gesture sail your butt doesn't have to hurt.So that's a very specific answer to a person specific question.So we took the time we took the thought to create very tightly knit groups of the medically relatedkey words with ADD text that matches and what most what's most important to remember is our text ofthe ad and that landing page answers the specific question they were asking were not answering theirspecific question with General.If all of our keywords are just in one group and we said come to our site because we have great officechairs that would be a general answer to a specific question of somebody search Google for heavy dutyergonomic office chairs or heavy duty office chairs and we acted with a generic ad it's not as goodas answering it with a specific ad because we're once again just to review this concept.We accomplish two things we're more relevant in the eyes of the human in the eyes of the consumer wherehey that that was the goal.That was exactly my question you guys are answering exactly what I was asking.That's amazing.And we also get more relevance in the eyes of Google which is this ad text is very related and relevantto the query and that's going to create a good user experience as Google and Google is going to awardus with a higher quality score because of that.So it's a really really fantastic way to structure the scripts.Once we decide to start setting up our key mid level bids and getting more on top of our default maxCPC bids that's what we're going to start thinking about what type of consumer is this queer representingwhere in the buying Funland.And I'm sure you guys remember the stage of the buying funnel right awareness.Right.Awareness is when a person is learning about the product interest shopping and buying.So I'm sure you guys remember those funnels those final stages and these keywords that we have so farwill represent certain stages.Where are all likely to represent certain stages in that buying funnel.And when do we start setting up our bids.That's when we want to start really understanding what type of stage in the buying funnel.Do these cubes represent.And that's how we're going to determine how much we're willing to pay per click and we're going to talkabout that in a lot of detail when we talk about discovering bids and coming up with a profitable biddingstrategy.But for now the next thing we do is talk about adding our billing setting up our billings are askedto start running.And that's we're going to cover in the next section.So this was a really good chapter in structuring a campaign to include multiple tightly knit group themesof keywords.We pulled it altogether from the research that we're planning in the Keywood organization that we did.And now we have them live organized and ready to rock in our hours campaign.So let's jump ahead let's go set up our bill and get that out of the way and then we'll come back andtalk about biz talk about quality score.Talk about adding campaigns and really diving into creating a superstar account and then we'll moveinto some live data from some of the counts in our agency and start taking a look at how to analyzedata and how to optimize campaigns because that's the whole other half of running profitable ad wordscampaigns.So thanks very much.Thanks for watching this one.And it's getting to some really exciting stuff and I'm looking forward to seeing you in a few secondsor a few minutes or a few hours whenever you decide to continue and watch the next section.I hope it's real soon but either way I'm sure I will talk to you very soon and in the near future.Thanks so much guys.And we'll see you later
