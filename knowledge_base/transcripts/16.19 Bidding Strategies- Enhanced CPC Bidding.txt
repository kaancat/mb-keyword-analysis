# 16.19 Bidding Strategies- Enhanced CPC Bidding

Heidi.Google ads fans are.Welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about the semiautonomous bidding strategy, which is the onlysemi-autonomous bidding strategy called enhanced CPC.Or this would also be the same as selecting and manual CPC and and selecting to add enhanced enhancedCPC to that strategy.They're both the same thing.The objective here is to retain a lot of control over your keyword level bids, how much you're willingto pay for every specific keyword in your account.But you also want to give a little bit of flexibility to Google to go around 20 to 30% above that maxCPC.If Google thinks that will lead to a conversion or if it's more likely to lead to a conversion.So it maintains that tight control.It also puts some trusts in Google algorithm algorithms to optimize your bid, your maximum CPC bidfor more conversions.How it actually works.Again, pretty straightforward.Using Google's computer system, Google will automatically raise your bids as much as 30% or decreaseyour bid to as much as 100% based on how likely they think the click is to lead to a conversion.And.Our background and my experience has shown that giving Google this level of autonomy actually couldbe very helpful because Google's Google knows a lot.They have a lot more data points than we do, and they're able to crunch that data much, much betterthan we are.And they have a pretty good ability to predict if a certain click from a certain person is more or lesslikely to lead to a conversion.So it's sort of saying, I have my keywords, I have my understanding of what a keywords are cost.I have my historic data.But.I know that Google has a little bit more personalized information in each person.So enhanced PBC does sometimes work to maintain or increase conversion volume while decreasing costper conversion.Like I said, we have seen that happen.You still set your max cost per click bid at the keyword, aggregate or campaign level, so you stillhave that complete level of control in hand.CPC starts off with modifying 50% of your traffic adjusting based on performance.So it's it's tempered.Google won't do this 30% increase or 100 up to 100% decrease on every single keyword.It starts off with 50% of the traffic.Well, yes, they'll do it on every keyword, but they won't do it with every impression.They won't do it with every potential click.They'll start off with 50%, and then they'll sort of figure out how much their enhanced CPC strategiesshould kick in based on performance.So it's a pretty good, pretty interesting system.So there are a lot of scenarios why this might work.In fact, most scenarios that I could think of, this could be something worth testing.But say your company has strict guidelines on budget and you want as much control over how much youpay for any given keyword.That would be a great, great reason to use manual CPC bidding because every keyword does representa different type of buyer.We know that we spoke about commercial intent, we spoke about what's expressed through search terms,but you're also tracking conversions and feel that your bids can be more optimized than they currentlyare.In that scenario, enhanced CPC is a good place to start experimenting with automation, right?And that's another good thing to point out.Getting started with automation could be a little scary.It could be daunting, like you're losing control of how much you're paying per click.And yeah, that's true.But automation can be very good.And of course, we don't care about control.We don't care about our ego, we don't care about our pride.What do we care about?Profit.We care about making money so enhanced.CPC is a really great place to start experimenting with some of these different automated strategiesand to see how Google changes our bids and what our results actually are.And of course, we have to make sure we're tracking conversions, we're tracking conversion value sowe could assess if this is actually making sense.If you want to test this in a more isolated environment, I would suggest having two campaigns thatare mirror images of each other and for 4 to 6 weeks have one campaign set to just manual CPC and onecampaign sent to enhanced CPC.And you could even use an AdWords campaign experiment, which I'll teach you how to use campaign experiments,draft experiments to run this against each other.And you could really see side by side which campaign is producing results.Do I get better results on enhanced CPC?Do I get better results on standard CPC?And that's a really interesting test.And when we we'll talk about campaign experiments and testing as we go along, but that's a really goodplace to start.So I look forward to seeing you guys in the next lecture where we talk about manual CPC bidding, whichwill be very quick because it's essentially the same thing as enhanced CPC bidding just without theenhanced CPC bidding turned on.And we'll wrap up our discussion about these bidding strategies and we'll go back and continue withour campaign setting something up, our very first campaign.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the next lecture.Cheers from now.
