# 7.1 Managing Costs

Welcome back.In this module in this lecture we're going to talk about the second pillar of effectively managing GoogleAds campaigns.And this is managing costs like we previously discussed.Uh, and I repeat this line, the only measure of a good advertising campaign is whether or not it generatesmore money than it cost, whether it's profitable.That's what we're doing here in performance media.So we want to really make sure we understand all the different levers and ways of analyzing costs andbudget as we build out, optimize, and improve our campaigns over time.So there's a few things that are important to understand when we talk about managing cost.Number one is your bid amount.And that also includes bidding strategies and CPC or cost per click.The bid amount is how much you're willing to pay for each click on your ad.Remember, Google Ads is a PPC platform pay per click.You're only getting charged when you get a click and Google works in an in an auction based system,every single time there's a Google search, there's an auction where all the different advertisers havean opportunity to give Google a bid to show an ad for that search query.There are different bid strategies you could be bidding manual CPC.We've talked about target CPA, target return on ad spend.We'll talk about those in more detail shortly.But the bid strategy is not arbitrary.It has to align with campaign goals.Whether the goal of the campaign is to generate a lot of traffic.So maybe you'd use maximize clicks, or is the goal of the campaign to generate a lot of impressions?Do you want a lot of people seeing your ad, or like most of us, is the goal of a campaign to driveconversions?So the goals that you've set out to, the goals that you have established are going to impact the biddingstrategies that you want to use, at least at least as at a starting point for your new campaigns.Next, you want to understand competition and the inventory available.When we talk about inventory, we mean how many searches are there a day for every given keyword?And of course, you have to keep in mind keyword match type.How many available searches are there that you could actually bid on?The level of competition for your chosen keyword affects the cost per click.More competitive keywords will typically have higher CPC.So you know, this is a classic example.Lawyers and personal injury law.The value of a client to a personal injury lawyer is very high.The timing is really important.Um, the we talked about, right.Perceived motivation, motivation to work with a personal injury lawyer when when a person feels thatthey can get a settlement is extremely high.So those factors and there are a lot of there are a lot of personal injury lawyers out there.So all of those factors make it that those clicks are going to be very expensive.But again, they're not going to be expensive because Google's establishing that they should cost alot.They're expensive because all of the personal injury lawyers that are advertising on a specific keywordare telling Google that this is what we're willing to pay for a click.We've seen clicks over $1,000 a click.It's not uncommon to see clicks in the hundreds of dollars a click range.For most businesses.You're going to be at the dollar two, three, $4 a click on search advertising, which is still very,very expensive.So this idea that Google has leveled the playing field and has made it equally easy for everybody toget involved, is not true.The best brands that are generating the highest lifetime value from their customers and clients.They are the ones who are going to reinvest that money back into advertising budgets.I have this conversation with clients a lot where a client might say, well, our we, we have to havea four times Roas.So what does that mean, a four times Roas or a 400% return?That means for every dollar they give Google, they're expecting $4 in revenue back.So I'll ask them and I'll press and I'll say, well, where does that number come from?Why 400?And they'll say, well that's, that's that's really profitable for us and that's what we want.And I say, well what about 300?Is that still profitable and just not as much.And they'll say, yeah, it's still profitable, but we really feel we should be earning a 400% return.And then I'll explain to them as follows.I'll say to get a 400% return with your conversion rate, your clicks are going to have to cost $0.90or $1.20.But we're seeing that clicks in this industry are averaging $3, which means you're going to be underbidding and therefore you're going to be getting much less traffic because you're going to be winningway fewer, far fewer auctions.And the client will say, well, why are the clicks so expensive?Why don't why can't you reduce the cost of the click?You're the professional.Well, the answer is no.We can't just reduce the cost of a click because all of your competitors that are selling the same thingas you, they are either doing one of two things or they're doing both.They either have a higher conversion rate, which means they have a better well-oiled machine.They have a better website, they have a better landing pages, they have better pricing, whateverit may be.They're getting a better conversion rate.A greater percentage of the traffic that they're generating are converting.So therefore, the revenue that they earn per click is higher and they maybe can maintain 400% returnswith some more aggressive bids.Or and this is usually more likely the other competitors are not as interested in short term profit.The other competitors are maybe using Google at a 1 to 1 return, or they're even losing money and they'reokay with it, or they're getting a 200% return and they're okay with that because they understand thevalue of generating new customers.They understand the value of how competitive they can become in the marketplace by earning market share.So their goals might be very different than yours.So the reason why clicks are more expensive are because you're arbitrarily setting a 400% Roas benchmark,because that's what you'd like.That would make you feel good today and tomorrow and the day after.But your competitors are not going to roll over and play that game.Your competitors are going to outbid you every time because they're okay with a 100% return.So that's an important thing to understand when you when you when you look at the competition and youthink about what the competition might be doing.Similarly, the availability of ad placements for chosen keywords can influence the cost and visibilityof your ads.So inventory could mean inventory on search could mean inventory on Gmail.It could be inventory on the display network.It could be inventory on YouTube.There are a lot of different factors that go into inventory that are going to impact how much your CPCsand your CPMs are going to ultimately be.And finally, conversion rate.When you improve your conversion rate, you get more sales or leads from the same amount of money spenton ads.This means better results without increasing costs.It's worth repeating this.Working on your conversion rate is one of the best things you can do to generate a more favorable economicpicture from your campaigns.Conversion rate is just a percentage.Remember, conversion rate is not a number and not a volume of traffic.Conversion rate is not a volume of conversions.Conversion rate is just the percentage of website visitors that convert into a revenue generating action.So if you increase your conversion rate from 1% to 2%, you're doubling your revenue, but you're goingto have an even greater impact on your profit because it cost you some amount of money in acquisitiontraffic.Maybe you cost you $1,000 in Google Ads clicks to generate 100 visitors and one sale, but now you'vestill spent $1,000 and you've generated two sales.So maybe your profit is $800 per item sold or per client.So you were losing money from those thousand dollars because the clicks are expensive.But if you figure out your messaging, you improve your landing page experience, you generate more.You improve the clarity in your materials.Now you've generated $1,600 in revenue from the same $1,000.So conversion rate is a very, very important element to focus on.
