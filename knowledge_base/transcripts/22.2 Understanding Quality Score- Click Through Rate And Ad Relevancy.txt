# 22.2 Understanding Quality Score- Click Through Rate And Ad Relevancy

Your site about quality score what it is how it's calculated and really taking a look at the ad auctionin depth and really understanding add rank and how your actual CPC your actual cost per unit cost perclick is calculated.Some of the things in this course and these next couple of videos we're going to we have already coveredin this course at the very least it'll be a refresher.And this information will just help help you to solidify the knowledge that you already have but it'salso just very good to repeat some of this and to get a more detailed sense of how this all works.So let's dive right in and we'll get started by a brief overview of a quality score is what it meansto Google and what it looks like and what Google looked like in the pre quality score erain order to first understand what quality score is and how it came to be.It's important to first understand what Google is at its most fundamental level.Essentially Google is a massive referral service.People come to google looking for referrals when people need to find something on the Internet.They ask Google where they could find it.They ask Google this question by typing a query into the Google search box and Google provides themWeb sites that hopefully contain the information.Google's customer you was looking for.So it stands to reason.From a business perspective that Google cares a great deal how relevant their suggestions or referralsare to their customers.The more closely a web page that Google offers you to provide the information you're looking for thebetter experience you're going to have the better experience you have when using Google's referral servicethe more likely you'll be to come back again in the future and use google to find information on theInternet.Again if Google send you to a Web site that offered PowerPoint tips when you were searching for someoneto buy power strips you might not use Google as frequently in the future and worse you might even beginusing another search engine like being on Yahoo.It especially stands to reason then that Google also cares a great deal about this same sort of relevancywhen it comes to the ads they show their users ads that are shown above their organic search resultsads that are the bread and butter of their business model accounting for more than 97 percent of theirtotal revenue.So Edwards quality scores stripped of any technical jargon is Google's way of ensuring that their customershave the same high quality referral experience with a paid ad as they do with an organic result.Now that we understand what qualities core aims to do at a conceptual level Let's take a closer lookat how quality score actually works how it's calculated and what it's comprised of.One of the first numbers seem to be familiar with is something called Ad rank your ad ranke is justa number that determines what ad slot your ad will show in the advertiser with the highest ad rank getstheir ad in the very top slot on the search engine results page or surp your ad rank is calculated ina live auction.Every single time a search performed on Google.The question is how does Google calculate your ad rank.Great question.Let's take a closer look at how Edric was calculated in the Prete quality score eraquality score was introduced in 2005 and up until then the Adwords auction was a really simple thing.The only thing that really mattered was your Macs cost per click or CPC for any given keyword or inother words how much you told Google you were willing to pay for an ad click triggered by a specificquery.Let's take a look at an example auction.Let's say Brad Ben and Brett all run online shops that specialize in custom tailored mens briefs.Each of them tell Google to show their ads when someone searches for bespoke men's briefs that willbe our keyword.Brad sets his max CPC for that keyword of $3.Ben sets his max CPC a $2 and Brets only willing to pay about a dollar fifty per click for that specifickeyword.So back in the early days Brad would win the top ad slot or position 1 since he had the highest maxbid.Ben would take the second spot and Brett would take third spot.Not to confuse matters that are no longer relevant but click through rate or CTE or did in fact playa role in the ADD ring calculation before quality score was introduced.Actual add rank took into account of keywords click through rate since a keyword with a very high bidbut no clicks was not only obviously not relevant to users but it also wasn't making Google any moneyno matter how much an advertiser was willing to pay for that click.What's important to know now is that before quality score came along the highest ad rank was essentiallyawarded to the highest bidder.But once quality score was introduced everything changed and things got a whole lot trickier.So as we saw in the previous example calculating ad rank based solely on Max CPC bid did very littlein the way of ensuring a high quality user experience with paid ads as long as your advertising packetswere deep enough you could place first on the results page with highly relevant ads and shoddy Web sitesyou were sending clicks to Google being a premier search engine and not the local Penny Saver didn'twant for example an insurance company running an extensive branding campaign and showing their ads tousers are not insurance related queries.While those ads may have been profitable for the advertiser in the long run they disrupted the streamlinedand highly controlled environment.Google wanted to provide its own customers.So taking those considerations into account.Google introduced quality score in 2005.Before we talk about the quality score equation is a couple of more worthwhile things to note.The first thing worth understanding is that every single key word in your account has a quality scorerated on a ten point scale.Here's what your quality score columns look like in the actual Atwood's account quality scores hiddenby default.But you can find it by clicking on columns customize columns attributes and adding quality score.You can drag and rearrange your columns as you see fit.Move it up here in front of clicks hit apply to save these columns and I can see your quality scorealong with your keywords and the account will come back and spend a lot more time in the actual accountslater.But here is just an idea of what your quality score shows up and what it looks like.You can see historical qualities score data from within your outwards account.In other words you can only see what your quali score is now not what it was yesterday or how it changedover time.There are some great third party tools and adwords scripts that you can run to collect this data andwe'll talk more about that later on.While Gullu themselves never confirmed that an internal account level quality score exists it's generallyaccepted that your overall account has a quality score that in some way or other impacts your overallperformance.In any case the better your key level quality score is the better your account level quality score isgoing to be.Display network quality score is another murky area and it's known that improving your click throughrate on any non-Serbs campaigns will improve the efficiency of your display campaigns as well.For our purposes here we'll be focusing on the tangible Claudius core data that our account actuallypresents us.He would love a quality score on the search network only.Let's dig a little deeper now and take a closer look at the individual components of quality score.There are four main factors that Google considers when calculating Keywood level quality score on thesearch network click through rate is the number one most important of them all.There are a number of important details to discuss here and we'll get back to them shortly.The second factor is the relevance between the keyword and the actual text.The third factor is the relevance between the key word that triggered the ad impression and the actualquery the user typed into the Google search box and the fourth factor is what we'll call landing pageirrelevance.Let's take a closer look at each of these factors individually.Click through rate can be thought of as the People's Court and when thought of that way it makes a lotof sense from a logical respective why TR is the most important factor in determining your quality scorefor any given keyword.While algorithms can do a great job at a lot of things they still can assess human appeal as well ashumans can and essentially a key words actual click through rate tells us how appealing your key wordand add combination is to actual people using google search.Just to clarify your CCR is calculated by dividing the number of clicks.A key word has received by that keywords number of impressions and then multiplying that by 100 to getthe percentage.So for example a keyword with 279 clicks and ten thousand 546 impressions has a quality score of 2.6percent.You take the point 0 to 6.Multiply that by 100 and you get 2.6 and that's your seat.In other words 2.6 percent of the people who see an ad triggered by that keyword actually clicked onit.It goes without saying that the higher this ETR the higher your quality score will be.Now at this point you may have a few questions.First you might be wondering what's a good seat.Well unfortunately there's no real answer to that question.There are so many variables that go into every unique circumstance that it's impossible to know whattype of TTR you should be aiming for and what type of CCR is normal for your industry and for your keywords.Oftentimes you'll be running a broad matched keyword and aiming for a lower spot in the page in whichcase you'll probably get a lower CTR than if you were bidding more aggressively on a phrase or exactmatch cured and targeting a higher position on the page.That leads us to your next two questions.A How does Google know what a good CD-R is and B how does Google calculate this part of my quality scorefor brand new keyboards with no click through rate data.Well the answer is that Google pulls from its enormous database of historic data to get ballpark figuresfor what your city should look like in your industry for your keywords and for your specific bids.You also know that ads in lower positions on the page typically get lower CD-R's and you may be wonderingif Google penalizes your quality score for poorer click through rates due to a lower position.The good news is that quality score is normalized by AD position which means that Google understandsthat CD-R's will inevitably vary based on position.And Google does assess your ads position when determining the health of your click through rate.It's also worth mentioning that Google tracks your display you are Ehle click through rates for eachad in an ad group and incorporates that into your key word level a portion of your quality score.Because of that it's always a good idea to get in the habit of testing different display or els withinan AD group to see which ones yield the best features.We've been talking a great deal about relevance and the relevance between your keywords and ad copyis a really important thing.Google knows that in order for your ad to be relevant to the user the text of your ad should talk aboutthe themes your key words are present.Often people make the mistake of stuffing their keywords into their ad copy numerous times but that'sreally not what Google is looking for.Google wants to see Aztec's that is medically related to the keywords in that ad group.For example if your keywords are cannoned print or a pair online computer help and harddrive retrievalfor example it's OK to have add text that talks about online tech support even though it doesn't necessarilyinclude all your actual keywords to be safe though.It's always a good practice to try and include the main keywords in your headline or the first descriptionline of the adwhen we talk about repairing quality score later we'll go over ways to ensure add text and key relevancyin greater detail.Remember it's completely fine if different add groups have completely different keywords and altogetheras long as the keywords and ads in each particular ad group are reflective of one another.There won't be any issues.The sentence phrase term or question a user types into the Google search box is referred to as a query.So whereas your keywords trigger ad impressions user queries triggers search results pages.Google calculates quality score for your keywords in real time every single time a search was performed.Not to confuse things unnecessarily but the quality score you senior count is not necessarily the actualquality score awarded to your keywords in real time.One of the factors that goes into your real time quality score is the relevance between the users queryand your keyword.That triggered your ad impression.Likewise Google also takes into account the relevancy between the query and the ad copy.That's going to be triggered by the keyword.The same reasoning applies to the keyword add text relevance.We discussed just before Google understands that the more relevant searcher's query is to an advertiserskeyword word an add text.The more relevant and useful that adds an overall user experience is likely going to be careful useof dynamic keyword insertion can help with ad copy queries relevance and appropriate use of keywordmatch types will help ensure your viewers always remain relevant to the user's actual query and we'lltalk more about that later.I'm certainly not recommending that you know traditional broad match doesn't have a place and time butit's just something to keep in mind when optimizing for quality score landing page quality is the leastweighted factors in calculating quality score.And most advertisers don't run into landing page issues but the elements of landing page quality aredefinitely worth knowing and understanding.There are five primary categories of landing page relevance or landing page quality as it's often referredto first and foremost.Yep you guessed it.We have landing page to keyword and add relevance.Then we have something called landing page load time which is really a really non issue nowadays.Then there is Spider ability transparency and Navigon ability landing page relevance is very similarto the other types of relevance we've discussed.Google wants the user to continue to have a great experience after leaving Google.After all a referral service is only as good as the places it refers its users to your atut end userson a web page that relates to what the user is looking for.If the user was asking for an answer to a question or a solution to a problem your landing page shouldprovide that answer or solution.Just like with ad copy your landing page need not contain all your actual keywords.As long as the content of your landing page is thematically related to the key words in your AD groupyou'll have nothing to worry about in this area.It's also important include enough text on your landing page for Google to recognize as irrelevant.There isn't a set number of characters to satisfy Google's bots but if there are more images than textin your landing page that's a fair indication that you may run into some trouble.It goes without saying try to include actual text instead of images of text whenever possible.If I had to throw a number out there I'd say two to three paragraphs of relevant text should be a minimumamount to ideally aim for.Remember don't do anything dumb like repeating your keywords over and over again or make the color ofyour text the same as the background.Google smarter than that and you'll get penalized.The content of your landing page should also be primarily unique to your Web site.If you're using manufacturer descriptions etc. try to enhance them with your own additional contentwherever possible
