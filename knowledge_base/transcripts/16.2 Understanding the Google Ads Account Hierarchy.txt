# 16.2 Understanding the Google Ads Account Hierarchy

How do Google ads fans and welcome back.Before we can name our campaign, we really need to understand the Google ads, structural hierarchyand then just some concepts and figuring out how to structure campaigns.Over the years doing this, a lot of clients and a lot of students struggled with like, it's a littleoverwhelming.I have campaigns, ad groups, keywords, ads, accounts, multi client centers.I have a big website.I have all the different products, I have different services, I have different colors of differentproducts.Like how do I structure a campaign?Like What do I do?Well, there's this a good system that you could use, and I'm going to teach you how to do that inthis lecture on how to figure out how to structure your account and how to break out your campaigns.And again, I want to reiterate, there is no right or wrong.There's different ways of doing this.And as we learn more about Google ads, as we understand keyword matching types, for example, as weunderstand different types of ads, we might want to structure campaigns differently for the sake oftesting different things, for the sake of different organization and based on what our business resultsare.But there are but there is a good starting place system.But first, let's talk about account hierarchy and we're going to jump to the whiteboard real quickfor this.In Google ads, there's a few different structural components to a to to an account.So at the very at the very top level, you have your Google AdWords or your Google ads, rather account.And at the account level, there are different settings that are only applicable to the account level,but we'll get there.Then you have campaigns under your account, you have all sorts of campaigns.You could have many different campaigns.You could have hundreds of campaigns.You could have campaigns that are different campaign types.You can have search campaigns, display campaigns, retargeting campaigns, Google app campaigns, Googleshopping campaigns, so on and so forth.The point is campaigns.Ah, the next level down.So let's say we have three campaigns here.So you have an account inside accounts.You have campaigns that all, all campaigns operate on this level of the hierarchy.And there are different settings that you could set at campaign, at the campaign level that you don'tset at the account level and that you don't set at the ad group level.Within campaigns you have what's called ad groups.So we're just going to do ad for ad groups.So you have another ad group.At Group.You might have to add groups in this one and you might have, let's say.I don't know.You might have more add groups and you can have hundreds of ad groups.Inside any given campaign.So ad groups are inside campaigns inside each ad group.There are two things that operate on the same level of the hierarchy.You have ads.And you have keywords.Ads and keywords are both contained inside every ad group.You need to have both ads and keywords in every single ad group in order for that ad group to function.If you're missing one of those two things, then nothing will function inside those ad groups.Now, at the account level, you're dealing with things like.Your specific email timezone.Billing settings.And user access.Other associated apps, things like that and more.At the campaign level, you're dealing with things like location targeting.Och, that's a big one where these ads are going to show up.You're dealing with ad scheduling.Ad schedule at the campaign level, you're also dealing with device targeting.There are certain settings that are available at both the ad group and the campaign level, such asaudience targeting settings.And we'll talk about audience targeting settings in a few lectures from now and what audience targetingmeans at the ad group level.You have ad rotation settings and other settings as well, and you'll see as we go through the accountand as we go through the account together, we'll see exactly what settings apply to what level of theaccount hierarchy.The main thing to understand, though, is that you have this hierarchy in a couple of the big settingsthat are available at the campaign level, like location, ad scheduling, and that ad groups are containedinside campaigns, inside aggregate.So your ads and your keywords, your keywords are sort of the mediator between an ad being shown oran ad being available to be shown, and a search term search terms are what the user actually typesinto the Google search engine.Remember we spoke about that in the previous section.Google will then look to your keywords to see and based on match type, we're going to spend quite abit of time talking about keywords and match types.Google will see, is this keyword eligible?Is it related enough to the search term?Does this account want to show an ad of the impression and ads are what will then rotate in differentways for a specific group of keywords inside an ad group.So you could have many, many keywords, right?You can have hundreds or thousands of keywords, not hundreds of thousands.There is a limit to the amount of keywords.Google does change that from time to time.You could have many, many different keywords and many different ads.Inside one ad group.And what that would mean is that all the ads inside one ad group, let's say you have 20 ads, they'llbe eligible to be shown for any one of the keywords inside that same ad group.So that's when you have to start thinking about thematically related groups of keywords inside eachad group.And there are a number of reasons why you want that to be the case.We'll talk about that once we get to writing ads and quality score and understanding keyword thematicallyrelated groups of keywords and things like that.So now you understand the precise hierarchy of a Google ads account.Account campaigns are inside account ad groups go inside campaigns.Ads in keywords go inside ad groups.And you can have multiple ads and multiple keywords inside every single ad group.There are a couple of settings that are set up at the campaign level, some of the settings at the aggregatelevel, some settings at the account level.But it's important to remember that there's a couple of different reasons why we might why we mightwant to structure a campaign in a certain way.One is to control specific settings, and the other is for our own internal organization.So, for example.Say we were dealing with a sofa company or an online furniture company, and we'll go through an exampleand we'll go through a specific case study of of an online furniture company.You might want to separate out the campaigns by product type.You might have a campaign for sectionals.You might have a search campaign for sofas, a search campaign for recliners.Now, technically, that could all be done inside one campaign, right?I can have one campaign and I can have I can have an ad group for so SOFA as an ad for sectionals andan ad for recliners.Because let's say my location targeting my ad scheduling doesn't change.So I'm not forced I'm not totally compelled from a technical perspective to have separate campaigns.But I would like to have them separated out by ad group.I'm not technically compelled to have them separated out by campaigns, but from my own organization,I might want to be able to keep things separate.I might want to give different budgets to different product groups.I might just want to be able to log in and look at my campaigns and see which ones are performing better.There's you'll get a sense of organization, and I would recommend doing that at a product level.But if you only if you're a business, let's say you're a service your service business.And there are certain types of services that you'll offer within a 100 mile radius of your your location.There are certain services you'll offer within a 20 mile location.Then those specific services need to be broken out into separate campaigns.So one campaign will have a 50 mile radius targeting, and we're going to go through location targetingshortly.And another campaign will have that 20 mile radius targeting for the service that is targeted only within20 miles.That's will be a reason you bring out campaign now that you understand the structure and the hierarchyof an account.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about how to look at your website's navigation to get a basicsense of how to start breaking out campaigns.And I will see you guys very shortly in the very next lecture.
