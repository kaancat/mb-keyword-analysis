# 16.10 Setting and Configuring Languages

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back in this very quick lecture.We're going to talk about language settings real quick.Let's jump back into the computer and take a look at language settings.Google prompts us to select the languages your customers speak.It defaults to English.And since this is an English Google ads account, you could select multiple languages.You could select all languages, you could select one language.It's up to you.But how does this really work?So say, for example, you're selling hats online and you want to target Spanish people, Spanish customers,Spanish speaking customers.You could create ads in Spanish, written, written in Spanish, and you could have keywords that areSpanish keywords and you could select the language Spanish for your campaigns, which means if somebodyis in the United States, let's say, but has their Google interface settings, Google calls this yourGoogle interface setting set to Spanish and people.When you when you sign up for a Google account, you can select your default languages.So if a person goes to Google and searches in Spanish or even searches in English, but they have theirsettings set to Spanish, then your ads will be eligible to show if you're targeting Spanish speakingpeople.However, and this is important to remember if a Spanish speaking person is searching on Google.com.In Spanish, but their settings are default to English.Then your ads will not show.If you're only targeting Spanish people's Spanish speaking people, you'd also have to target Englishspeaking people.So a very common approach for people who want to also serve Spanish speaking people.You would select English and Spanish.Remember that even if you select Spanish as a language, that doesn't mean Google is going to translateyour ads.They're not going to translate your ads.If your ads are written in English and your keywords are in English, that's how they're going to appear.So if you only have English ads and a person is searching in Google in Spanish, then most likely they'renot going to see your ads.Google detects Google.Google properties have default languages, so google.com defaults to English, Google FR defaults toFrench, so on and so forth.When a person is searching using one of those language specific or location specific domains, the resultsthat they're going to see are going to be by default in that language.So if a person is searching on Google FR and you don't have any French ads, then your no ads will beshown.Even if you're targeting French speaking people and even if you're targeting that location that theads are appearing in.So remember, it's important on the search network.It always goes by what Google calls your Google interface settings, which is settings in a person'sGoogle account, which detects what language in Google by default you're going to be interacting with.So for us, most of the time, we're a New York based agency.We our our ads are in English.But for you, it might be different.Let's say your customers are they speak French.So I could start selecting I can start typing in French and I can select French.And if I want to do Spanish, I could type in Spanish.I might do Hebrew.Right.So I have all these different languages and that's fine.That could work.On the right hand side, Google will suggest that I could add English.So if I want to add English, I could just click at all and it will add English in there and I can removeeach one individually by just axing out of the ones that I don't want.For us, we're going to select English because I don't want my ads showing up when people search inSpanish or if people have their their default settings, their interface settings set Spanish becausemy website is not in Spanish.So you have to think about that as well.We don't have a Spanish website for this client, do you?What language is your website or landing pages going to be in?What language your ads in?This should be a really, really straightforward setting to configure.And again, this is also a setting that you can come back and change any time.In the next lecture, we're going to start talking about budget and it's going to be fun.I look forward to seeing you very soon in that next lecture.
