# 16.20 Bidding Strategies- Manual CPC Bidding

How to Google Ads fans.And welcome back.Let's briefly talk about manual CBC bidding, which is my favorite bidding strategy, gives me the mostflexibility.It gives me the most organization, gives me the most control.And I highly recommend this be the strategy that you begin your campaigns with.It's really between maximize clicks and manual CPC and always go with manual, almost always go withmanual CPC.This is the bidding strategy of choice.The objective of manual CPC bidding is to always have complete, full control over your bids and everyauction.And when I say every auction, that means every single impression that one of your ads might be shownin.You're willing to pay what you're willing to pay, and that's the end of it.Simple.If I have a keyword men's boxers and I'm willing to pay $0.79 for a click, that's what I'm willingto pay.Right?There's not much more to it.And of course, what I'm willing to pay.Again, referencing my calculator, you should be able to figure out what your max ABC bid should bebased on your profit margins, based on your historic data in the account.How does it actually work?I have a default bid at the campaign level and the ad level.A default bid means that if I don't override the default bid with a keyword level bid, then all thekeywords in a specific ad group or specific account will inherit the default bid of the next level ofthe hierarchy.So going back to what we talked about hierarchy, you have campaigns and ad groups, then keywords.So if I have a campaign level default bid for $5 as a max CPC and then I create ten ad groups and Idon't change anything else, the ad group default bid will be $5, but I could have one ad group thathas a default bid of $7, one ad group with the default bid of $0.50.And then if I don't change anything from there, all the keywords in the 50 cent ad group will havea 50 cent bid.But inside the 50 cent bid ad group, I can have keywords that are bidding a dollar or $5 or $7, right?So it's complicated, but basically I have a ton of control.So I could also set individual keyword level bids.Like I just mentioned, I could override my ad group or campaign level bids with individual keywordlevel bids.Google will not bid more than our max and under any circumstance, which is great.That's what I want to bid.It's beautiful level of control.You could also go back in an ad and hand CPC at any time.You could layer in hand CPC on top of manual CPC if you choose.If you want to change your bidding strategy around a little bit and you could also change from manualCPC to target CPA, our target return on ad spend or target ranking share or target search page, location,etc..Best place to start does not need conversion tracking to work.I don't say that lightly.Like you should always set up conversion tracking.It's a big big no no to ever have an account that doesn't have conversion tracking.When we talk about how to audit an account, you're going to hear me say that the very first thing Ido is make sure the account is tracking conversions, because if you're not tracking conversions andeverything you do is literally just a shot in the dark.So you always want to make sure you have your conversion tracking set up, but you don't need conversiontracking set up.That's why when we go in and set up our bidding strategies, you could use manual CPC right away, rightfrom the outset.So let's jump back into AdWords and take a look at setting up our manual CPC strategy for our campaignthat we're building.So I'm back in AdWords over here and I'm going to select my dropdown menu and I'm going to choose manualCPC.And I have that option that we mentioned to help increase conversions with enhanced CPC.For now, I'll leave that off.It's really up to you if you want to put it on or off.It doesn't matter.I recommend using running it as a test, but that's totally fine.So I'm going to use manual CPC bidding.I don't enter in what my manual CPC bids will be over here because I'm going to create my campaign defaults,my ad group defaults on my keyword level bids later on.This is all I need to do.So you now have a pretty good understanding of all the different bidding strategies available to you.You should be able to explain this with sophistication to your clients, to your boss.You should understand how this works for your own, for your own campaigns and for your own account.And you should have a pretty good understanding of taking a look at your business, what your objectivesare, and what bidding strategy you want to do.And the big consideration will be, is this a new campaign that's not based on historic data, or isthis a campaign that I'm building based on historic data or or may I or might I be optimizing or changingor thinking about changing my bidding strategy in a campaign that's been running for a while, thathas data.And I'm going to use that data to decide what is the best bidding strategy to test.And now that you understand the dynamics and the objectives of each one of these bidding strategies,you should be in a good position to choose the one that will ultimately be the most profitable for you.And I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the next lecture, when we talk about start and enddates and we continue setting up our campaign, going through the settings in detail, step by step,I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of seconds.
