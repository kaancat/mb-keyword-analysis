# 16.25 Call Extensions

How did Google ads fans?Welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about call extensions, which is an exciting type of extension,especially for call center businesses, businesses that take phone calls, that generate phone calls,that want to generate phone calls.Right.It's a really important extension.So as you see here in the image, this number is a phone call extension.This is not to be confused with call only campaigns.That's a separate campaign type.We'll cover that in a separate chapter.Call only campaigns is where there is no headline.The headline is replaced with a phone number.They only run on mobile devices and they click on the headline, generates a phone call to a business,but there's no way to really get to the website.From the ad that's call only campaigns.Call extensions are your typical text ads with all your other extensions, your headline or description,but it also has a phone number attached to it.It's extending the ad with a phone number.So on mobile devices, on smartphones, a call extension is actually a button.And you can click to call if I choose to call, as opposed to clicking the headline on tablets and desktops.It's an actual number.And I could dial that number and we'll talk about how these phone calls, how these phone calls aretracked in a moment.With phone call extensions.With call extensions, you can select to only show during business hours.You can choose when these call extensions will actually show.And you could set up very easy phone call tracking using Google forwarding numbers.There are pros and cons to that.Most larger businesses, most of our clients, we will sign up for a service like call rail or if byphone invoke a mongoose metrics.And there's a lot of other much cheaper ones where you could buy specific numbers but for free.And I recommend doing this at least for call extensions, you could use a Google forwarding number andI'll show you how that works in a minute.The downside of using Google's forwarding numbers is that you don't keep that number forever.It's a pool.So if somebody comes to the website and writes down that ad and saves it right down to the phone number,right, writes down your phone number and saves it in their phone book or on a notepad, and they callit 90 days later.Google claims that you'll have that number for 90 days at Google forwarded number.But we found that there's been some problems even before 90 days.So it's a little bit risky.But in most cases, people aren't writing down and saving these numbers anyway.And it's worthwhile getting that tracking information because if you use a Google forwarding number,you'll know how long the call lasted for, how much you're paying for a phone call, the click to rate,all that stuff.A call is priced the same as a click on mobile.That's a question I get a lot.So if somebody clicks a call extension or if somebody clicks a link extension, it's it's priced theexact same way as if you would have gotten a click on that headline.So if you're if your actual CPC would have been 250, you're going to be paying $2.50 for a phone call.And the phone call doesn't have to connect.They don't have to actually you don't have to actually pick up.That's a big part of of people's confusion when it comes to phone extensions and how and how Googlecharges you.You don't have to have a connected phone call to be charged the same way if somebody clicks a headlineand your site never loads or somebody doesn't buy anything, let's say you still get charge for theclick.If somebody writes down the number and dials it from there their phone, their landline, or their cellphone, and that's through a that's a desktop or a or a tablet ad.Even if you're using Google forwarding numbers and Google could register that you got a phone call,you're not going to get charged.So that's the thing to realize.There's no action taken online specifically.You're not going to get charged for for that.Just a pro tip to know if you're using call extensions, that if you're also using location extensionsand your location extension has a phone number in it, your call extension phone number will overridethe location extension number, which is not the most practical thing, doesn't really come into play,and it shouldn't cause any problems, but it's something to know.Just in case you're asked that question or you see a discrepancy in your own reporting, it's good toknow.So let's just go jump back into the account and we could actually set up a call extension and I'll showyou how that works.Here we are back in Google ads and I'm going to open up my call extension options.And again, it looks very familiar and I'm going to click add new call extension and I'm going to configuresome of these options.So we're going to keep it set to the United States.And I'm going to enter in just a sample number or just, let's say two, one, two, three, 4198647.That's my sample number.So that's the number that I want the phone to ultimately ring and go into advanced options.Skip over the conversion action for a second.I could choose my device preference to be mobile or not mobile.I'm going to leave it for all three.I typically don't choose to have a preference for mobile because I'm fine if I want phone calls, Idon't really care what device a person is calling me from.Start date, end date.Again, same concept.If I have if I'm running a specific promotion or I'm only going to be available during certain hoursif I don't want my phone ringing during certain hours, I can have it at schedule, different hoursof the day, all that good stuff and configure that to the to how it's going to suit your business best.Now let's go back up to conversion action.And the default is to use account settings, calls from ads, which is going to be set up for you whenyou create this call.So if I select course from ads, that's essentially the exact same thing.I'm not sure why Google has these two separate things.If I select no conversion action, Google will not be using a forwarding number for this call extension.If I select one of these conversion actions, Google will create this cost from ads conversion actionin my account for me right after I get my first phone call, which means that let's say this is yourbusiness number.People are not going to see that number.And that's another consideration that a lot of clients of ours have dealt with when it comes to forwardingnumbers.For the sake of branding, sometimes clients just don't want people to ever see a number that's nottheirs or a number that's not going to be the number that they see on the website.I always push back and I say, Listen, we're investing a lot of money in advertising.We need data.We need to know you have a business line.But all these big companies, all the real legitimate players, have forwarder numbers, have a poolof numbers.They're able to track how many phone calls are being generated from a campaign.So eventually we got our clients on board.We have phone calls, we have phone numbers for PPC campaigns.We'll have phone numbers for specific ad extensions.We'll have phone numbers for different sources.We'll have phone numbers from Facebook campaigns from from chat bot campaigns from then.Then you'd use that same software to get phone numbers for print ads, radio, etc. And it's reallyimportant, especially if you're generating a lot of phone calls, it's really, really worthwhile.So my basic parameter is, is if you're generating more than 25% of your leads through phone calls,it's an absolute must have tracking if you're generating below 25% of your leads through phone calls.And it's not an absolute must because not that that not that less than 25% of your leads is not a significantamount of leads or volume.It's that you could use the metrics from form submissions as a proxy for anticipating what's leadingto phone calls.So if I'm getting a lot of leads and conversions through these keywords to these campaigns, then Icould typically assume that I'm going to get a similar performance if people are calling.But if I'm if I'm spending a lot of money and really generating a high degree of phone calls, if peopleare coming to coming to the site and call me from the ads a lot, then I really want to know what Ireally want to know which keywords are generating these phone calls, how much my phone calls are costing,so I could then go and optimize my spend to spend the most amount of money as possible in the most efficientareas of driving calls as possible.And the way to start off doing that is with tracking those conversions.And the cool thing is, once I have this calls from ads, conversion tracking automatically set up forme, I can then see a bunch of interesting information how long the phone call lasted for the area code,what keyword triggered the phone call?What search term triggered the phone call?Right.Lots of cool stuff.And I'm going to show you all of that as we break down conversion tracking inside of Google ads in afuture section when we talk about conversion tracking.So that's call extensions.It's not for every business.If you want phone calls and you rely on phone calls and you could close your deals through phone callsand phone calls are good.By all means.Add call extensions.If you're really, really reliant on phone calls and phone calls, work really well for you, then you'regoing to want to use call only campaigns, which also work extraordinarily well for local service companies.And we're going to have a lecture about call only campaigns for sure.And that's really all there is to know about call extensions.I will see you in the very next lecture when we talk about structured snippet extensions.Cheers from now.
