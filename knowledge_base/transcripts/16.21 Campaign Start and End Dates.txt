# 16.21 Campaign Start and End Dates

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.Just quickly moving through here in our bio computer, setting up our first Google ads campaign, wehave the option to set start and end dates.The start date is always going to be today, and then you'll have the option to select an end date fora campaign, the date that campaign would automatically shut off.I got to be honest, I don't think I've ever used this.If I'm running a campaign that is going to be shut off, we're going to be monitoring it close enoughto just pause it manually later on or remove the campaign later on.If you have a short time promotion like your have certain products that are on sale or you're only runninga deal on a certain service or whatever it may be, you could run sales like that at the ad group level,and that usually makes a lot more sense.But if a client only specifically wants a campaign being run for a week, or if you want a campaignbeing run for a predetermined amount of time, you're going away.You won't have access to be able to shut off the campaigns when the time comes.Then you could create an end date.If you're worried about overspending, you could use automated rules to pause campaigns or pause adgroups when they hit certain thresholds of spend.So again, most of the things that you would ever need an end date for could be set up in differentareas of Google ads, but it's there if you'd like it.So in our case, we're going to just select none for our end date, and we're going to move down forwardinto dynamic search ads.And in the next lecture, we're going to talk about dynamic search ads, what they are and how you canpotentially use them to your advantage.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in a couple of seconds.
