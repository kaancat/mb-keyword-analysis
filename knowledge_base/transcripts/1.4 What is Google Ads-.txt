# 1.4 What is Google Ads-

Howdy, Google Ads fans.And welcome back.In this lecture, I want to talk about some astounding statistics about Google ads, sort of what itis conceptually and at the very least make a compelling case if your boss or your or you're not readyor a client's not ready to really invest in Google ads, some of these statistics will really help themget on the Google ads gravy train of profits.So first, 75% of search market share.Google dominates search.Yes, there's Bing advertising and Yahoo advertising and the Bing advertising network.Like I would never create a separate course for Bing because it's really a duplicate of Google ads.So what's successful in Google ads?You could import it to Bing, but 75% of the search market share goes to Google.So that's an enormous amount of activity.Just to give a bit of a conceptualization of what that activity is, there's over three and one halfbillion daily searches on Google.People come to Google first and foremost.Now, Amazon is picking up some market shares as the place where people come to begin searching forsomething to buy.But the king by far is still and will probably always be Google.People come to Google to search for what they're looking to buy, to find answers to their questions,to get relevant information about purchasing decisions.1.2 trillion yearly searches.71% of all of Google's revenue comes from ads.And this is very, very interesting.Now, a couple of years ago, when I first created this course, that number was 97%.Now Google's revenue has increased dramatically, but that's because Google has gone into other typesof businesses where they're actually generating generating revenue from other areas.But still, 71% is a whopping number.And let's just put that number in a little bit of context.In 2017, Google's revenues were 109 billion.That's a billion with a B as in baseball, 109,650,000,000.That's a lot of money.That's a lot of revenue, 71% of that.So now what is 71% of 109 billion?650 million?Any math whizzes out there?Let's see.It's 71% is going to be.And you guys could you could fact check me on this one.But I think it's I think it's 77,000,000,800 and.51,500,000.I believe that's correct.I don't know.You could prove me wrong if I'm wrong, but $77,881,500,000 generated from Google ads over 80.That amount of money spent on ads generated over $80 Billion in economic activity per year from Googleads.And this entire course is teaching you how to take your piece of that.You could seriously generate significant lasting economic activity profits to your business from runningGoogle ads campaigns.In fact, we have clients that are spending and I'm not exaggerating.We have clients that are spending over $1,000,000 a month on advertising online through Google, hundredsof thousands of dollars.And that's their entire business.And they run big businesses and they and all their traffic, all their sales come through Google.And that doesn't mean I'm suggesting that you should put all your eggs in one basket.That's not I don't mean to suggest that all your traffic to your site, all your profits should comefrom Google ads.They shouldn't.It should be diversified.But that's the power of such a platform.Google ads, when done right, when done profitably, could generate enormous amounts of money.And it's generating enormous amounts of money for Google.This is interesting statistic that very worthwhile to understand.40 to 50% of all searches end in an ad click.I'm sure that you've heard this.I get this all the time from clients.Bill Isaac you know, Google ads is dead.No one clicks on those ads.I don't click on those ads.I scroll down past the first three ads and I find an organic result.Sure, plenty of people do that.Plenty of people search through and specifically won't click on an ad.That's the case.But the reality is right.The reality of the matter is 40% to 50% of all Google searches end in an ad click result in a clickon a sponsored result.Right.So 50, almost around 50, approximately 50% of three and a half billion daily searches are ending inan ad click.Just think about what that means.Right.Huge amount of ad clicks are happening every single day.So if you're going to come with the attitude or you hear the attitude that says, oh, no one clickson the ads, I don't click on the ads.My mom doesn't click on the ads.Well, you can tell them that's that's nice.But around 2 billion people are 2 billion searches a day are ending in an ad click.So that's that's huge.On top of that, 45.5% of people who were polled don't know the difference between a sponsored ad andan organic result.And that's really interesting because that's probably why this number is so high.Google does a good job at disguising ads for a couple of four through a couple of different factors.One is quality score.Quality score ensures that the ads are extremely relevant to what the person searched for.And we're going to talk about quality score.But also Google doesn't make it look like ads.You have that little green.It used to be more used to.They used to have I don't know if any of you guys remember this on Google.There used to be a yellow background whenever whenever there was an ad result and then they had a adark green or a dark yellow ad icon.And now it's just a little outline that says ad, right?It's really hidden.Like unless you're looking for it, it's hard to naturally tell that these three results are ads andthese are organic results.And Google does that on purpose because they want to mask that fact that there's an advertising ecosystemrunning in the background and in the foreground above the organic results.So 40 to 50% of all searches in an ad click.45% of people don't even know the difference between organic and sponsored results.And that's something which you could take incredible advantage of and you should take advantage of,and you should exploit that.You should make your ads look as natural and as native as possible.We're going to talk about what that means.The Google.We're going to talk about display advertising.And in the next lecture, I'm going to show you where ads actually show up.Google Display Network reaches over 80% of the entire Internet.That's a lot of potential display advertising.And display advertising is if you want to show an image ad or a video ad or a flash ad on on the NewYorkTimes.comor the Wall Street Journal or whatever, ESPN, whatever website it might be, you're able to do thatthrough Google Display advertising, which reaches over 80% of the entire Internet.So running display ads through Google ads through the Google ads interface gives you enormous, enormousreach.The core bulk of this course, almost all of the course is going to focus on search advertising, whichis advertising on Google, search on Google.com.And I'll show you in the next lecture exactly what I'm talking about, because people who are new toGoogle ads, sometimes it's hard to conceptualize exactly what we're dealing with here.Google ads is the software.It's the advertising system that allows you as a business owner or allows a business owner to show adsto people who are specifically looking for what you sell.It's the most luxurious advertising system in the world where you have Facebook advertising, you havebillboard advertising, you have radio, TV, all those things.They have to predict whether or not the audience segment that I'm choosing to target is interested inwhat I have to sell.So I'll choose people who are older.I'll choose females or males.I'll choose people who are more affluent.I'll choose people in certain locations.I'll do all these different things because it's the best proxy for knowing somebody's actual intent,what they actually want to buy.Like I might advertise on Facebook a business related product to frequent business travelers, right?But I don't really it's just the best thing I could do.I use I use all that contextual elements of targeting through through social.And that's not to say, again, I'm not putting down social media advertising.Social media advertising is extremely, extremely effective when done right.But the reason why Google ads on search specifically is so luxurious, why it's so different than anyother display sort of advertising where it's more interruptive.This is not only is it permissive marketing, a user is searching for the answer to a specific questions.I'm looking to buy men's running shoes.I'm looking for a local locksmith.Not only is it permissive, but you're able to show an ad.When a person is specifically searching for what you offer, it's extremely powerful.It exists nowhere else in the world.There's no other advertising platform that affords you that level of luxury, that level of specificity,that level of understanding, commercial intent, where you could really try and predict to quite anaccurate degree how likely a person is to be one of your customers.And it's incredible.Now, that also doesn't mean that this is going to work for you overnight.That doesn't mean that you can just throw $100 a day or $10,000 a day and you're going to see profitability.Because you have all your other competitors that are also capitalizing on this.They have good websites, they have good products.They know how to bid.They know how to have a customer support team.They know how to market higher top of the funnel clicks.They know how to create content and give away information in a way that's relevant and useful to theto the user.So it's not going to work by itself.It's not magic, but it is the most luxurious and that's why it's the most expensive.It's very competitive, especially competitive markets.Clicks are expensive.You get you get charged every single time somebody clicks an ad, which is the other element of PPCadvertising, pay per click advertising.So not only and I know I'm speaking fast, I'll slow down.Not only is Google ads the most luxurious advertising network and advertising system in the world,because you can capitalize on this thing called commercial intent, you could choose to show ads topeople.That are specifically looking for the products and services that you sell at the time that they're searchingfor the products and services you sell.Just let that sink in.That's incredible.That's enough of a reason to take this extremely seriously.More importantly, you don't pay.You don't pay a penny to show an ad.OC.PPC advertising pay per click advertising means you only pay Google.You only pay the advertising network when your ad is actually clicked.Now, that's different than most display advertising.Most display advertising, and it's also different than most Facebook campaigns, etc..What you're paying per 1000 impressions on Facebook, you can pay per click.It's different.There's different bidding options available on most display campaigns.You're paying per thousand impressions.You're paying to show the ad with Google.With Google Search, you could have an ad shown a million times if you have an ad, a position threeor position two, it doesn't get clicked 100,000 times.That ad was shown on the page.You don't owe a penny to Google.You only get charged.You only owe money when a person actually clicks your ad and comes to your landing page.So imagine you're you have a brick and mortar store on the street.Not only imagine offering.A certain amount of money to for a person to walk into your store and browse.Right.There's for sure a certain amount of money that's worth it to you because you're taking out ads, you'redoing all these different things.So whether that's $0.05, $0.10, $2 is there's some amount of money where it's worth paying peopleto come into your store, but it gets so much better.Imagine you're able to just offer that $0.25 or a dollar to people who, you know, woke up this morningand said, I want to buy the product.You sell your you're a hardware store.And a person woke up this morning and said, I want to buy a hammer.I want to buy an electric drill.Right.And you somehow knew that.And you could offer just those people to come into your store and browse your shelves and look at theproducts you offer and look.And you could even put them right in the specific aisle of the hammer or the electric tool that theywant to buy.It's wild when you think about how accurate and how powerful and how.Useful, how relevant these ads could be, how you could seriously chose choose to spend that moneyin the most effective way possible to on the people that are interested in what you sell.Getting them into your online store, your Web store, whether this be for services or for content orfor products, if it's ecommerce is.Incredibly powerful and it doesn't exist anywhere else and it's not replicated even in any other formin any other advertising platform.So these statistics should make a very, very strong case for the power of Google ads.And the very next lecture I'm going to show you a little bit a little bit about what these ads looklike in the real world, where ads actually show up a little bit, the anatomy of an ad.And after that, we're going to jump into creating finally our very first Google ads account togetherstep by step.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
