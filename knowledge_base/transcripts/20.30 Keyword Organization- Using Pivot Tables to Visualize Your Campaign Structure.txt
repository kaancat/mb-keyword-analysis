# 20.30 Keyword Organization- Using Pivot Tables to Visualize Your Campaign Structure

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back in this lecture.Let's talk about some simple but effective campaign visualization tools inside Excel.And that really comes down to using pivot tables and using pivot tables in a very elementary, basicway.So, first of all, I have to obviously change the spelling here.I misspelled the word chairs.You probably have caught that in the last lecture.So I'm going to change it up here.And again, double click and it changes it everywhere.Really, really simple.Now we have one campaign here.I'm going to reset the view.It's not important to see everything.But if you see we have one campaign, it's all office chairs.But say we had a bunch of different campaigns we're building out in Excel, which is very possible andvery doable and not a bad idea.So I'm going to go here and I'm going to actually copy.Everything.Paste it again.And I'm just going to change a couple of things.I'm going to change office chairs, let's say, to desk.Oops.I'm going to change office chairs to desk.Accessories.Let's say I'm not going to change everything.So let's say this is pen trays.And we're going to have we'll do something like.Paper holders.Then you might have a third aid group for desk lamps.And then you might have another ad group for wire organization.And let's say that's that those four adverbs.So the keywords will be the same for now because we don't.This is just for the sake of illustration.So we have two campaigns now say we want to visualize how this all looks and you might want to sendthis to a client or just for your own organization.So really easy way to do this.We're going to select everything by clicking the upper left hand corner.Now make sure the entire sheet is selected.We're going to go to insert and you can do this in Google sheets as well by inserting a pivot table.And because you have the entire range selected, we're going to go ahead and click.Okay.And here we have a pivot table.Let me zoom in a little bit.And there's a couple of things we want to do.First, we want to add our campaign ad group and formatted keyword into our pivot table builder andby default it shows up as row.So campaign, I'm going to drag over to the top here and I'm going to put campaign on top of ad groupand I'm going to take format a keyword and put it below ad group over here under rows.And now we have a visualized system for looking at expanding and contracting what we have going on here.So if I were to bring everything down.I see that I'm going to minus all the different groups.We can get a better look here.So at the very top level, we see, hey, we have two campaigns, we have desk accessories and we haveoffice chairs.Those are two campaigns.Now say I want to see a count of all the keywords inside those campaigns.Well, that's easy.I could take my formatted keyword out of rows and bring them into values.And now I see a really cool setup.I see I have 104 keywords in my office chairs campaign.I have 104 keywords in my desk accessories campaign, in my paper holders ad group.I have 87 keywords in my desk lamps, I have 20, so on and so forth.And same thing, you know, and we have 16 keywords in each of our office chairs, add groups.I could also go back into my builder and add match type and then I could see the count of match type.And of course, this matches up exactly because that's how we set up our keywords.If I took out match type by selecting match type and brought counter formatted keywords back under adgroup, I can start twirling things out and seeing a more detailed, granular view of what's going onhere.So under colorful, say office shares, colorful, colorful.I could click the plus sign and now I to see all the keywords that are inside this, this, this adgroup.I could also bring match, type back in, bring it from values over below formatted keyword.And I could say, oh, now I see that this is a phrase match, exact match bar match modified and broughtmatch over here.But of course, since we have it formatted correctly, there's no need to do that.So I'll remove match type over here.So this is a really cool way to visualize through a pivot table this campaign.So I could open up luxury and see, oh, the keywords and their luxury.I can open up desk lamps and see the keywords and their desk lamp.I can do the same thing with paper holders, right, and see all the keywords there.And you could zoom in, you could export this pivot table, you could take a screenshot of the pivottable and show it to a client.So that's really, really cool way.And if you have a lot of campaigns, a lot of ad groups, those are really helpful way of keeping everythingorganized.And the nice thing about pivot tables is as you update the raw data, as I update my ad group structureand I come back to my pivot table, whatever changes I make, if I change match types.Or I change the the number of keywords.Those changes would be reflected in the pivot table as well.So the two things I like to do is, is a getting an overview of the structure by being able to openand expand, but also getting a count.And remember to get the count, I just take formatted keyword and I move that over into values so Ican get a count of the keywords in each one of these add groups and in each one of these campaigns.And I want to show you one more cool thing that you could use for pivot tables, especially as you'rebuilding out these estimates.And this is extremely handy if you're doing this for a client.Remember, we were dealing with the Google keyword planner and some rush where we're getting all thesetraffic estimates like how many estimated searches there are per month.Well, you could do some really cool stuff.We didn't export that information, but if you exported that information, then you have it in Excel.If you didn't export that information, you can go and get it.But you could also, if you didn't export that information, you can go and get it.But I want to show you how cool pivot tables and how useful they can become if we're sort of manipulatingthat information, those numbers as well.So I'm going to go ahead and create a column and we're going to just use this as a fake example forestimated, let's say, search volume.Another column is going to be estimated CPR for click through rate.And now we're going to have estimated actual amount of clicks.These are three important columns.So for estimated search volume, the total number of potential searches, I'm just going to generatea random number.So Rand, between let's say between 250 searches a month and 25,000 searches a month.And I'm going to bring this down all the way.Well, I could just really double click.All right.Bring it down all the way to the bottom.So I have generated a random, random numbers for each one of these.Keywords.Fantastic.Now estimate a click the rate.The search volume is useful, but what about our click through rate?That's going to give us the estimated number of actual clicks.So for estimated click through rate, I'm going to do another random function by typing in equals randand I have myparentheses divided, let's say by ten, and I'm going to drag this down all the way.And I get some.Cook the rates ranging between 1% and change to up to 10%, a 9% change.And that works.Now, estimated clicks is easy enough.I was going to copy and paste and keep my values only.Values only and estimated clicks is you guys know the formula by now.You just take your estimated volume and you multiply that by your estimate, your estimate, a clickthrough rate, and you get a total estimated number of clicks and we have too many decimals there.Let's bring those down that.So if I have 7400 impressions and 5.13%, that's the maximum estimated clicks of getting has to do withbudget bring that all down.So now now I have the total number of potential clicks.At every single keyword, at every single ad group, at every single campaign level.And I'm actually going to quickly create a new pivot table by selecting everything that I've just added.Go back to insert again pivot table.Ad in my campaign ad group formatted keyword.Now I'm going to add an estimated six clicks just to start.So first, I'm going to bring my campaign over here.I'm going to bring my formatted keyword over here, be my campaign at the top, add group formattedkeyword, and I'm going to bring my sum or I'm going to bring my rather.Yes.I'm going to be some of clicks like that.And let's zoom in a little bit and see what we have going on here.Let's twirl everything down.And we start seeing some cool things.Again, I have two campaigns.I have office chairs and I have desk accessories.Now, based on my estimates, which of course were randomly generated, I could see that I have a totalof 175,000 available clicks if I bid on every single impression and if my click the rates are what theyare, what they say they are, then that's pretty, pretty cool.So I can look into my executive office chairs and say, Oh, at every single individual keyword, thephrase match version of executive office chair, I expect 2000 clicks at most.I can get 2000 clicks based on the click through rate of that keyword, so on and so forth.So using pivot tables, you could really get some granular, granular information.Now, of course, these are the rates here are probably too high and we could change those.And if you could always modify the raw data.So for example, if we were to go to click the rates and say where to divide everything by a third.So I'm going make a new column real quick.And I'm going to equals this click the rate divided by let's say divided by three.I have a smaller click to rate and now bring this down all the way to the bottom by double clicking,and then I'm going to copy and paste.So I have my values only.And then I'm going to make a new formula here where this column just equals this new column.Bring that all the way down.Get rid of this column.I have to make sure my estimated clicks still equals.Okay, great.And now if I go back into my pivot table and I click Pivot Table, Analyze, and I click refresh, wesee instead 175,000 clicks.We see a total of 58,000 clicks because we basically chopped everything down by a third.I go into my desk lamps and say, oh, four computer desk chair, exact match.I'm going to have 199 clicks maximum.Anyway, really cool.So you could add your estimated search volume, you could add your estimated CTR, right?And you can have all this data.And as you twirl up into the ADD groups.You can see that at the ad level, and then I can twirl up again and see everything at the campaignlevel and see that four office chairs.That's a total number of estimated clicks for desk accessories.Some of us have made it search volume.Some have estimated.Or you could get an average for, let's say, for a click through rate.You would want to maybe get an average.So for click the rate, I can go to the info button down there and instead of some look at average andthat would give me an average click the rate across the keywords across the click, all the click,the rates of the keywords inside of all the values from the raw data inside that campaign.So anyway, very cool stuff.Pivot tables are really, really helpful.But even if you're not adding in the search volume and even if you're not adding in the estimated clickto rate, etc., it's very helpful just to be able to visualize the structural build out of a campaignaggregates keywords using pivot tables.So now that we have everything in our raw data, we could start adding these keywords and adding thesead groups back into Google ads.Before that, I want to show you it.Spend one lecture showing you a couple of quick tools that would really could really be used as a shortcutfor this, if you want to.Very, very helpful.And then we'll talk about getting some ad groups uploaded back into Google ads and then, of course,some basics of determining your starting cost per click bit.So I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
