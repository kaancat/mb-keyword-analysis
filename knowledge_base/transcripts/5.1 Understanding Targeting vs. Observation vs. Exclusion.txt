# 5.1 Understanding Targeting vs. Observation vs. Exclusion

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about targeting versus observation versus exclusion when it comesto audience targeting inside Google.When we're targeting when you select targeting, you're choosing who sees your ads based on specificcriteria like age, interests or other factors to reach people more likely to respond.So targeting just means, okay, I have a whole population of people.Let's just say I take the United States.I have 400 million people.I only want to show my ads to men.Okay, now it's 200 million people.I've.When I select a demographic and I select targeting for that demographic, it means specifically showads to just people who meet this criteria.Do not show ads to any individual who does not meet that criteria.If it's men within a certain age group, if it's men within a certain age group, plus in an interestcategory, maybe it's men in an age group, or maybe it's just anybody who's been to my website in thelast 30 days, I'm going to use a remarketing list and I'm going to select targeting for that remarketinglist.That means I only want.Google to show ads for the people on that list.Contrast that to observation, which is just.A reporting technique.It just is instructing Google to give me a separate column in my spreadsheet, in my Google Ads reportthat shows me my clicks, my impressions, my CPC, my time on site, my bounce rate, my conversionrate, my value, my Roas for a specific audience definition.So with observation, I'm not really doing any targeting, I'm just watching.We watch how different groups react to our ads without limiting who can see them.It helps gather data to improve future targeting.So this is like a big confusion.People get all tied up about observation and targeting.What should I do?You have to understand targeting is just what it means.It means I'm actually going to direct ads just to certain people.Observation means I'm not doing any targeting.I'm just watching.So if my ads are targeting the entire United States and I add an audience that is a remarketing audiencefrom the last 30 days of website visitors, or it's men between the ages of 55 and 65, or it's, um,anybody who Google thinks is in the market for athletic gear.And I select observation.I'm still showing my ads to the entire population of the United States.But Google will then show me a report breaking out that audience or those audiences, so I could analyzeif that audience actually performed differently.And then I might see, hey, men, between 55 and 65, um, who are in the market for athletic gear,actually have a three times higher conversion rate.So I might create a new campaign with a dedicated budget and just target that audience as opposed toobservation and exclusion as it sounds, is preventing certain groups from seeing our ads to make surethat our messages and our ads and our dollars don't go to people unlikely to respond or who aren't relevantto our products, our services, or our goals.So an exclusion list is is as it sounds.I could define an audience.I could say people who have been on my site in the past 30 days, but who have not purchased I wantI want to stop showing them any ads.That's what an exclusion list is.So it's important to understand the difference.When we talk about audience targeting as a broader category within audience definitions and audiencetargeting, you have actual targeting, specifically showing ads to a specific groups of people thatwe define observation, requesting that Google break out a reporting view just so we could see if differentgroups respond differently to our ads and exclusions, telling Google here, target everybody.But just make sure to exclude this group or exclude these five groups.Again, however we define those definitions.In the next lecture we're going to talk about audience targeting options and the different tools availableto us to supercharge our campaigns and to make sure that we're reaching the correct people.
