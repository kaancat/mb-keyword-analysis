# 6.4 Isaac's Top 5 Tips for Creatives

Welcome back!Here are my top five tips for creatives on Google.Number one, hook them fast.So look, you don't have that much space, but you have a couple headlines.You have a couple descriptions, 35 characters for a headline, 90 characters for a description, maybesome site links.We're talking about text ads here.Um, and even with image ads across meta, even with image ads on LinkedIn, even with YouTube ads,you have to hook them quickly.Um, and a hook doesn't necessarily mean something funny or or outlandish or extreme.A hook means what?I'm here.I'm here to tell you something relevant.I saw, um, a really good ad for for for hardware, internal cabinet hardware that said jewelry foryour cabinets.That hooked me.Um, if I saw clothing, a clothing manufacturer.Right.The the colorway for this crewneck sweatshirt that sold out seven times is back in stock while supplieslast.Not the most ingenious headline ever, but it hooked me.So hook somebody quickly.Don't go.Don't start like high.And look.This could come across in many different ways, but like, don't you got to get to the point.You got to get to the point.And what you have to understand with the hook is that the hook has to incentivize the next action step.So this is like a really important thing to get right.The headline of an ad doesn't have to sell the product.The headline of an ad has to generate a click.The landing page that you get to, or the headline of the landing page doesn't have to sell the product.The headline of the landing page has to encourage you to read more.The product page doesn't have to sell the product.The product page has to get you to begin a checkout.And then the checkout has to sell the product.All right.So when you try to do too much with a headline, you're you're going to end up hurting your capacityto achieve good results because you're trying to incentivize something that, that, that a certainpiece of content is not meant to incentivize.So a headline for Nike running shoes might be over 475,000.Nike running shoes in stock.Okay.Like I don't again, it's clear to the point, but I've hooked you by saying, come along with me forthis ride.We might have something you're interested in.Or maybe it's the only the only online retailer with a curated selection of Nike sneakers by in-housefashion designers.Okay.I don't know, but it's like you could you could hook them with something that's interesting and relevant.Or maybe you're running a really competitive offer, a really competitive promotion.Audience number two.Audience centric creativity.Um, when you think about visuals, you think about tone of voice.You have to understand your audience.And here's an example.Like there's you have Macy's and let's say you have Bergdorf Goodman or you have Saks Fifth Avenue,or you have the Chanel boutique, very, very high end.They're both designed very differently.Their catalogs look different, their colors look different.Their the interior design is different.The customer service is different.Very, very different from each other.If Macy's looked, felt and behaved like Chanel, their business would suffer.If Chanel looked, behaved and acted like Macy's, their business would suffer.So neither of them are doing it wrong.They're both catering to an audience.Macy's is is building a very, I would say, specific, tailored and strategic vibe.And Chanel is building a very tailored, specific and strategic vibe catering to their audience.So when you think about your audience, you have to think about who are they, what do they like, whatstage are they are.What stage are they at in life?Are they students?Are they successful?Are they parents?Are they middle class Americans?Are they workers?Are they into politics?Are they part of academia?What are the tribes that people are associated with that might define an audience for your product andcater to them, even if it's not a style and a tone of voice that you necessarily like.Three Dynamic Visuals With Clarity and Design.When we talk about ad copywriting, focus on clarity.If within three seconds somebody's looking at your ad, doesn't know what you sell and why you thinkI should buy from you today, then I'm not being clear enough.You have to focus on clarity.If somebody's reading the ad doesn't fully understand what the product is, you're not being clear enough.I can't tell you how many ads I come across a day, and how many landing pages I come across a day whereI'm scrolling or I'm looking.I'm like, I don't know what you sell.Look, e-commerce and food, you have it easy.Show a picture.Always show a picture of the product.I had this argument recently.Not an argument, but like a back up with a client.Client client sells a really cool AI software that allows customers to build no code apps.And we're dealing with like animation and graphics and and whatever.I'm like, stop, get rid of all this.Show me the product in the ad, show me the dashboard, show me the UI.That picture is worth a thousand words.Be clear before you.Before you build the more emotional brand cute creative messaging assets, you got to deliver the mostimportant message, which is this is what you can do when you buy our product.This is what the experience will be like.This is what we offer.And that might not feel creative, but it actually is a very creative pursuit.If you could distill, if you could get something down from a complex idea into a simple, clear messageto me that is the pinnacle of creativity.Number four data driven creativity and design.Listen to the data.If your data is indicating that women are your market, or that kids are your market, or that adultsor older people are your market, or people from certain states or in certain climates or with certaininterests are your market, then incorporate creative elements that those people will find attractive.If your if the data tells you that a price point is too high, or a style is ugly, or your servicedelivery, the way you're delivering your service is, um, poor.Or if the data is telling you that that an ad is not working, cut it.Like Stephen King says, kill your darlings.That's the editing process.That's the part of the part of the beauty of performance advertising is that it doesn't take a lot ofmoney and a lot of time to create ad assets, test, iterate, and kill the ones that aren't working.Listen to the data, incorporate elements that are appealing and attractive to your audience with empathyand humility into your creative assets.And five A unique visual identity.Look, this is not, um, rocket science, right?We remember brands based on how they look.Now, that doesn't mean you need to go and spend a lot of money on your logo.Adventure media was a very successful agency for many years.We actually have a new logo now, but my first logo was on Fiverr for for $5 and that's fine.It didn't matter.It didn't matter that we had a different one.What very few brands actually, the logo matters for very, very few brands.Yeah, you could think UPS, Fedex, Coca-Cola.Okay, Amazon.But the logos didn't make their business.And I don't care how many case studies you throw my way.It could have been 100 logos that that end of businesses would have been just as successful.But a visual identity matters.So try to be consistent.Um, if you have a specific color scheme, you have a specific illustration motifs, um, use them.There's a reason why watermarks logo reveals are used and are important because people will rememberbrands based on those.Um, color, geometric, shape based patterns.There's there's something about those different elements together that create very strong neural networksand associative associations in the brain to help persons say, okay, if I'm scrolling down, I getwhat this is.So, for example, I can give you like I've been looking at masterclass is a is a is a an online courseplatform very successful.They have all the celebrities that teach all these different interesting topics.They sell a subscription.But the moment you see a masterclass ad on meta, you know it's a masterclass ad because they have avery unique color scheme, style, type of music.And that's good because it reinforces that this brand exists.Um, I will say that a unique visual identity is the least important thing here.Most of you are here thinking about performance, driving results, text ads to a landing page, toa good product, to a good service.Um, we recently grew a lab grown diamond business from $0 in revenue to $350 million in revenue.That's not an exaggeration.I didn't misspeak from.We were working with them from before their website launched, and within 24 months, we generated $350million in revenue in a crowded space going up against major competitors.And this company.Our client had no brand grown brilliance at the time, had no brand.Their website was offshored.It was broken for half the time it was being fixed, being repaired.A logo was done in Photoshop by an intern.I tweaked it a bit.$350 million with no brand.They now have a brand, but you could do a lot before you invest, and I and I would recommend mostof you not investing heavily in a unique visual identity, but to think about consistency and tone andconsistency and style.Um, all right.So we've covered key pillar number one, understanding the user messaging audience testing keywords,negative keywords, match types.And with all of this information, you have a really good sense of how to empathize with the user andall the different tools that Google offers to manipulate what users see, your messaging and how muchyou bid, and how aggressively you you engage with those users.And we're going to move on to key pillar number two, which is managing the budgets, managing the pursestrings, managing costs.And of course, I'll reiterate, the only admirable advertising campaign is a campaign that generatesmore money than it costs.So it's really important to understand the economics of an advertising campaign and how all the differentfeatures, tools and tactics within Google allow you to manage and mediate all the different cost considerations.So thanks for watching.So far, I look very much forward to seeing you shortly in the next module.
