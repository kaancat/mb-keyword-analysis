# 23.4 How To Create New Campaigns That Will Improve Your Results

Howdy and Reds fans and welcome back to this exciting course.And in this chapter we're going to talk about expanding our account by adding a new campaign.We spoke about campaign hierarchy.We understand that an account includes campaigns address and keywords and settings campaigns includeadd groups add groups contain ads and keywords.We initially decided that our overall campaign structure should be based on on top level item topicand product category from our website pop and dot com because if you remember we're advertising we'recreating an ad campaign for Poppen office furniture and we started off creating this first campaignover here called Pop in USA furniture.USA was was an identifier to say that we're going to be showing our ads in the U.S. only and furniturewas to signify that this is going to include all product categories from the furniture section of Poppinsover to the pop and Web site take a look at that again.Here's the home page.And if you go to furniture we see all these different sub sub product categories under furniture andwe began building out a campaign for if you remember desk chairs.Now if you go back to our campaign you look at our structure we have all these add groups for all differenttypes of desk chairs.We have the armless colorful conference desk chairs qued or nomic.And we noticed as we started building this campaign that there really were a lot of different groupsthat we could just target for desk chairs.So this is a great example of the dynamic nature of building a campaign and how sometimes your accountstructure changes and your strategy changes how you want to structure that account.And what I'm thinking now is to create a separate campaign for all the other office furniture subcategories.So I want to have a separate campaign let's say Well you know start with file cabinets next OK filecabinets have a whole bunch of different subcategories like three door to door sliding door rollingfully loaded.And then there's also accessories for file file cabinets.So there's a lot of different there's a lot of different keywords and Arabs that we could segment thingsout by for the file cabinets itself and it might get too confusing to add all the file cabinet add groupsinto our overall furniture campaign.And we also want to not just add one group for all file cabinets because remember the more ad hoopsyou have by product category the more specific you could talk to your customer.So if somebody goes to Google and searches for 3G or file cabinet.I'd love to have an ad that talks about three drawer file cabinets I'd love to send them to this pagethat sells the three drawer file cabinets.Same thing if somebody typed in a rolling you know rolling file cabinets for sale.I'd love to send them.I want my ad to talk about weevils and rolling and the product characteristics that they were searchingfor and send them to this specific page pop and dot com forward slash furniture forward slash rolling.So that's really what I want to do because there is a lot of ad groups just under file cabinet itself.I would like to add a new campaign that's just targeting file cabinets but that also means that I needto rename this campaign to not just be talking about furniture I need to identify this campaign.So how do we change the name of the campaign.There's two ways we can do it.One of them is to simply navigate to the wall campaigns area by clicking on this upper left hand itemcalled all campaigns it's always there in your dashboard.As long as you have your left hand menu panel open and go to the campaigns tab you'll see all your campaignsso I can simply click the upper right hand corner of this little box when I hover over in the campaignand just click the pencil icon and I can edit the name of my campaign.OK.I could similarly edit my campaign by clicking into the campaign where they dropped me onto the ad groupstab and I could hover over the name on the top of the screen here and edit the name here.I like changing campaigning here because it gives me a little bit more room to work with in terms ofhis ability.So I'll keep this called furniture and we'll just name it.Furniture chairs.OK.So that's kind of following or maybe called desk chairs but we can definitely follow how it looks hereso desk chairs on pop dot com if we see over here it's called desk chairs.So you want to.It'll be great just to name our campaigns in the naming conventions that mimic the Web site itself.So I'll go over here and just name this desk chairs and click save.So now I know that this campaign is specifically talking about gestures now in good shape to go aheadand add my new campaign.So how do I add a new campaign.Well I go back to my campaigns list and I have this big red button Plus campaign.This plus campaign button is exactly where I'm going to start creating a new campaign song and go aheadand click on plus campaign and right away I'm presented with a whole bunch of different options.But don't be overwhelmed it's just one option that you need to know for Google's search ads Google searchads are the most profitable and that the most common and the most successful form of advertising.So you want to go ahead and just click search network only Google search and search partners searchnetwork only.That's the only type of campaign that we're going to be running when we talk about Google search ads.When we want them on display ads we would add a new display never campaign shopping video promotingyour app.There are different types of campaigns you could run an ad words.But for our purposes and for 99 percent of advertisers we want to be primarily focusing on job searchnetwork only which means when somebody goes to Google dotcom or someone if we select search partnerssomebody goes to you know AOL dot com and does a search for a product or service.Those are the web properties that we want to have our ads display.So just go ahead and click search network only.And if you see what we have here it's very very similar to the initial screen we saw it's a little differentbut it's not all that different whether it should be completely foreign to you.A few things that we need to reiterate and remember how we're going to structure this campaign.We always want to click on features all features gives us greater flexibility in the different settingsand the different targeting parameters that we can control.Okay so we're not looking for a mobile app installs.We're not trying to drive mobile app engagement.We're not running a call only campaign these are different features for different types of advertisers.We just simply want to stick with all features.Ok now I'm going to name this campaignpop'n see call it you know we'll it's only talking the USA.And our top level categories furniture and we're going to be targeting file cabinets so this will bea file cabinets campaign and we have our name Daury obviously as we just saw it always change the nameyou can only.That's not a big deal.We could load settings from existing campaigns.I mean I could choose an existing campaign to take the settings which would take the schedule of takethe automate.It would take the bids it would take that budget but I couldn't do that.We're going to just create new settings from scratch under the networks area where presented with anoption to include the search partners or to exclude search partners.This is a a setting which has no best practice or rule.If your customers are using AOL and your customers are using you know Ask.com a whole bunch of the differentpotential search partners or Google Google does not disclose who all their search network partners are.Then that would be potentially a good idea.But like once again I think we we discussed this already.If your budget is not extremely high and you're just starting off I would highly recommend just includingGoogle search network and excluding search partners.You know that's really the only thing you do.You should be spending your money on because Google the Google search network usually brings the besttraffic and the highest quality visitors.OK devices ads will show on all audible devices by default is nothing that you could change now.But once again we'll go ahead and take a look at setting up big adjustments in a later chapter.Here we have the same locations area as we had before.So I'm going to choose just the United States.Once again I can go into this advanced search box and exclude or include any specific countries outsidethe US.So I could let's say I want to exclude If I to include everywhere in the U.S. except for text as I wouldfirst have to include the United States by adding starting to type the Unites States adding that countryand that could exclude exclude.That's a Texas for example.So now I would be targeting the U.S. targeted locations and excluding Texas as a location so that'ssomething I can do is remove that and we could just include the U.S. I have some more advanced locationoptions if I turned this down over here.And we always want to search people in my time.Not always but in most cases we want to select people in my targeted location and people in searchingfor actual injuries in Mike's location leave that selected over here.Basically what that means is if if I'm excluding Texas and somebody does somebody does a search or sayfrom New York for file cabinets in Texas or file cabinets in Dallas then my ad will not show becausethat's indicating somebody is looking for you know file cabinets in Texas.If I just selected people in my location then if somebody is in New York and somebody types into Googlefile cabinets in Texas then my ad would be eligible to show as long as it matched a keyword.But I'm just going to leave the recommended default setting for the exclude parameter.I want to only be targeting English properties and English speaking people.So I'll leave that as it is.And of course are you will want to set.We might want to manually set my bid for clicks over here.I'm going to put in a default bid once again because we don't have any data yet.We're going to be using a basic bed we can make you know make that bid $2 and 25 cents for an hour andwe'll put this at a $50 daily budget.Google says it gives you a little warning here that actual daily spend may vary.That's because your budget might not be depleted right.You might only spend $40 a day if my key level bids are too low for example or if there simply too littlevolume for the key words that are in this campaign or in these ad groups I might not even spend my $40a day.Alternatively I might spend a little bit more than $50 a day you should be prepared to spend 10 to 20percent above your budget.And that's because Google calculates how much you're spending.But by the time your ads get shut off there's sometimes a little bit of a delay and you might have accrueda couple of clicks in that timeframe.So even if you put a $50 day budget it's very common to spend $54 $55 $58.That's a totally normal and totally accepted in our delivery method advanced.We want good accelerated.We want to spend our budget more quickly because I want to see how much volume is out there.And I'd like to see how much potential reach I could have so I'm happy to check you know has acceleratedfor now to get a sense of what's happening over here we have an extension.We could start creating some extensions.We will go ahead and create a call extension right now and we'll go back and create site link extensionsin a later chapter cross-sections are good because you know for our company let's say we want peoplecalling in because we take orders over the phone and I'm just making that up.I don't know for sure.It does take orders over the phone.But listen they may and your business may so call extensions really powerful type of ad extension andwhat it does is it and it adds your phone number either after the headline or below the headline ofthe actual ad.So it gives you more real estate on the screen and also gives users a chance to call you without evenclicking an ad.And that's a really cool potential option.So if we hit call extension and we select this we'll have the option to now create or add a previouscall extension.So we have this call extension here this number on going to selected by clicking this arrow.Now it's selected and I'm going to I'm going to click Save on it.You know I don't actually I don't even need to click save because I'm going to click out of this box.But what I want to do is show you with the edit menu looks like over here.I have the ability to show this extension on just mobile devices desktop desktop and tablets only orall devices.So I'm going to choose to click only mobile devices because that's the I feel or my research has shownme that that the mobile users will generally call and sometimes have a I'm I want to persuade my mobileusers to call and not to click through onto the website because sometimes the connections are slow onmobile phones.Sometimes the web browsing interface is not as smooth as a desktop so I want to encourage as much asI can my mobile users to call so I'll choose to have this call an extension just a mobile devices andmy desktop visitors.I want them to go to the Web site because the buying process is so smooth and I'd rather not have salesagents or sales representatives be on the phone with customers who are likely to check out online anyway.So I have this phone number selected if I can go into this menu over here on the right hand side theedit menu and I could choose a few different options here I can choose that I can choose the type ofphone number this is.This is the U.S. number and I want to select a Google forwarding phone number in most cases this isvery good and smart way of setting up this extension.What this does is let's say this number here to 0 1 8 7 6 9 8 7 6 that's my actual phone number.A Google forwarding number will display a separate number.It'll be a totally different number from a pool of obviously millions of numbers and that number ifsomebody calls it will forward to It'll forward to our office number.And what that allows us to do is to track phone call conversions.That way we'll see how many ads lead to phone calls how many phone calls came from and because Googlesees a specific number that they know they place by my ad and if you call that number it'll route thatcall to your main number that you select here.But Google track it as a as a actual phone call conversion.I could checked I could de-select that by hitting my own phone number.Do not create a 40 number.Sometimes companies have a lot of brand recognition around their phone number so they don't they don'tneed a Google forwarding number.But in most cases it's a really smart thing to use the Google forwarding number under the advanced menulike I could select starting and date for this extension to be visible and create a custom schedulefor it.And over here by default it's select to report phone call conversions count calls as phone call conversionsand the conversion action is set to call for mass.This is something which is set by default that I would just leave it as is and then I click safe
