# 16.28 Message Extensions

How do you glass fans?And welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about a very exciting type of ad extension called Message Extensions.Now, this is not like call it extensions or extensions where everyone should use them.This is very business specific.Message extensions, as you can imagine, is giving users the ability to send you a text message.So if you're a service business, this is huge.If you're especially if you're a local service business, this is huge.We have a client out in Las Vegas.They're also in Miami, in New York now that offer hydration therapy for hangovers, for beauty treatments,etc..And 96 or 97% of their business comes through people booking on a mobile device.People are just searching.They're out there.They're a little hung over.They're at a hotel.They're traveling.Right.This is not a desktop based advertising campaign.And we found that message extensions have been working really, really well.Message extensions allows you to choose a the option instead of clicking on an ad and going to the landingpages, messaging the business via your text message app on your phone, it's really cool.So let's walk step by step through creating a message extension.So I'm going to twirl down my message extension window.And of course it looks familiar.We don't have any here.Again, these are reusable and I'll select new message extension.So first I'll need a phone number.So again, it's just use Google's example phone number.Put that in the extension text is what the text shows in the actual ad.So it's your call to action.So send us a text for more information is kind of boring.So let's say we are a company that's offering discounts or we want to get people to text us becausethat will help us generate more leads and sales.So we'll be text us now for 15% off coupon.Och the business name is will be like IE6 carpet cleaning or you know, we could even do this for poppinso we could do pop in office furniture.We might as well stay with our theme and the extension text could be text us or 15% off.Now again, a huge international office furniture company might not have the capacity for text messages.But luckily right now, as I'm recording this, Google is in a a beta program to allow messages to interactbetween a mobile device and desktop computers.Here's my primitive drawing.I'm not even really sure why I'm drawing this.And here's my mouse.OC.Currently, when you're setting up these message extensions here, you're going to allow your usersto text you.So it's going to be a phone to a phone.So something somebody like Poppin, you know, might not be set up for this sort of interface.Well, you never know.They might.But once Google rolls out a full beta that allows sales reps to interact with text messages, text basedmessage extensions from a computer similar to any like live chat software that you see on on computers.Then it'll be very effective for a lot of additional businesses like in fact, we have we've used livechat on our website before, but we don't have anybody here who is on their cell phones all day respondingto leads.We don't want that in Vegas.Our client, it's really good for them because they're out all day on their phones and they manage theirwhole business through their phones.So it's worked out really, really well in their favor.But once Google allows people to use message extensions with the advertiser, us or your client usinga computer to interface with people on their cell phones, I think then it will become even that muchmore effective.So keep an eye out for that.So back here into AdWords, we have our extension text texts now and then the message text, right?The message text is the default text that will pop up when you click that message extension that willthat you'll have the option to send to the advertiser to send to the company.So here I'd like to know more.Please text me back or be like, you know.Please send me my 15% off coupon.And it could be much longer.We have up to 100 characters for this for this message.Now, you also have the same advanced options again, start and end dates and specifically in specificdaily schedules.But before we could run a message extension, you have to turn message reporting on.So if I click turn on message reporting for our account, it'll be defaulted to on and I'll click saveand then message reporting will be on.I can preview what this looks like in an ad by clicking preview and you'll see that this is what itwould look like.There's a little bit of a message icon.Text us now for 50% off coupon.And if a user clicks that I get charged, not if they send the message.That's something very important to remember because in your reports, you might see a discrepancy maybe.How did I get charge this amount?I only got this amount of actual text messages.Well, you don't get charged.You'll have a certain percentage of people that will click that that will click that extension, butthey won't actually send the message.But you still get charged.Unfortunately, that's how it goes.So a person could choose to click the headline or a site link extension.But if a person is more interested in in text messaging you, then they could click that message extension.So it's a really, really great feature to offer people in general.Again, we're going to move now into conceptual a conceptual concept or a concept, rather.I don't mean to be redundant.The concept is always give the users as much information as possible.Advertising has shifted over the years.It used to be that the advertiser was in control.We, the consumer, relied on advertising, relied on on us to give them the information that they neededabout products and services.That's no longer the case.The consumer's in control now.The consumer asks for the information when they wanted.The consumer interacts with brands, how they want to.The consumer engages with companies when they want to, on what devices they want to on their terms.That's where we're shifting in.And Google's push into message extensions is really to compete with Facebook encroaching on Google'sturf, Facebook with their very mobile, optimized experience.And mobile is king.Now, I'm going to show you charts later in the course that has shown that's going to show you the incredible,enormous mobile dominance.There's just more mobile searches, more mobile activity than ever before.There's more mobile searches and add clicks on desktop.So mobile is really becoming the supreme device for Google's own revenue and for advertising and foradvertisers.So this is so Facebook's been doing really well there with Facebook messenger marketing chat bots.It's very mobile optimized.And Google's sort of pushing and trying to get their advertisers that are in their ecosystem saying,hey, you could you could allow your customers to interact with you and your leads through mobile byusing message extension.So that's very cool.And I would absolutely anticipate Google eventually in the next few months or the next year rollingout message only campaigns where the only option is to send a text message, because that is reallyclearly following the progression of how they've rolled out different ad products over the last coupleof years, especially since the beginning of my career.They rolled out the call only and now the text message extensions, messaging extensions that we'resending up right now and then messaging extensions that will be allowed to monitor by on desktops bythe advertiser.And they'll for sure roll out message only campaigns at some point in the near future.But anyway, if you want to run message extensions, that's how you set it up.You go ahead and click Save and you are good to go.And you could add additional message extensions.So you could have I would if I was doing a message extension campaign.What I do is I'll set up four different message extensions with a separate call to action.I want to test my call to action, so please send me my 15% off coupon is one.Another one would be message for updated company information.Another one would be send us a text message for a special gift.Maybe I would ask just a revenue question.Do you like do you like neon orange?You know, and then I'll talk to them about some of our products and how we're such a colorful companyand things like that.And I would just test different ideas to see which one, which headline gets me the most text messagesactually sent.And that's a good way to test the effectiveness of, of message extensions and to test my actual messaging,my brand voice, my brand personality.And it should all be tied to not what you like or what your client likes, but really what generatesthe best click to rate, what generates the most profit.So that's message extensions.In the next lecture, we'll talk about location extensions, how those all work and we'll move on fromthere.Thank you very much for watching and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in a few seconds.
