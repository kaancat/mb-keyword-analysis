# 10.1 Overview of Campaign Types

Welcome back.In this module we're going to talk about all the different Google Ads campaign types and specific strategiesfor using each of those individual campaign types.And when you think about a campaign type, you're really thinking about an objective understanding yourbusiness.Obviously you have a website, but what industry are you in?What are you looking to accomplish from a campaign?Is it direct sales?Is it signups?Is it awareness?Are you looking to get downloads of an app?Are you looking to get really good video content that you have seen by as many people as possible andgenerate more traffic?Um, when you identify some of those campaign objectives, then you could better understand how to matchup a campaign objective with a specific Google Ads campaign type and a particular strategy that mightbe effective for that campaign type.So we're going to go through first an overview of each of the different types of campaigns that youwill have available to you when you're setting up your Google Ads account.So search is the most common and probably most well-known campaign type.These are text ads on Google search results pages.So when you do a Google search for any search, you're going to see, um, 3 to 4 searches at the topof your search results page.Those are your text ads.And the placement where these ads appear is only on Google search results and on search partner results.If there's another website or another search functionality that's using Google's search functionalityfor their website, then Google Ads will be able.Google ads search campaigns will show results there.As long as you have the the partner network option toggled on when you create your campaigns.And we'll talk about that when we go through a full, um, dashboard walkthrough in a few videos.The most obvious use case for search campaigns when you're targeting uses specific keywords.So if you're looking to show ads for when people are searching for products and remember when we talkedabout keywords, when you're searching for a product, you're searching with queries.But Google is going to take a look at the query and say, does that match any keyword in your campaign?And should we?And they're going to ask themselves, should we show an ad?So if you're looking for sales, if you're looking for direct results, if you're looking for that sortof core search advertising, what that has to give you.Search is always the place to start.The reason why search is so effective is because you're capitalizing on real time in the moment.Commercial intent.If I sell pens or I sell business services, or I sell whatever it is that I sell, I could show anad to somebody who is actively searching for that product or service at that moment.Of course, like we've spoken about, it's competitive.It can be expensive.You have to look at your conversion rate.You have to look at a lot of different factors.But from a traffic acquisition perspective, there's no better, higher quality campaign type than search.But search is very far from the only campaign type available, and search is by far is far away.The only campaign type you should be using.The second most popular, um, campaign type is performance Max.It used to be considered sort of smart shopping, but smart shopping migrated to performance Max andperformance Max is Google's unified campaign that delivers advertising on all of their ad inventoryacross all placements.There's a lot to talk about.Performance, Max.We're going to be recording our own unique performance Max course, where we're going to dive into thedetails and best practices and ideal setup, data analysis, all of that good stuff for performanceMax in particular, but for now, just understand that when you run a performance Max campaign.Google's basically saying, here's a proposition stay out of our way.We'll deliver you the best possible results, which means you're giving up as you're letting Googleuse as much I as possible.Um, you're telling Google that you're happy to show ads on all of the inventory, search, shopping,display, YouTube discovery campaign inventories on on the Google mobile app and in Gmail.And this is best used for a comprehensive campaign across all Google channels.But you want to use it specifically because Google's giving the best inventory to Pmax.Now, you can often see the best results.Even if you're looking for search traffic, you could often see lower CPCs and better conversion ratesfrom performance max campaigns.So I highly recommend um advertisers explore and take performance max seriously.Demand Gen is Google's way of targeting ads, specifically on YouTube, Discover and Gmail, and that'saimed at driving demand.Now, when we say demand, what does that mean?It's really Google's fancy way of saying don't expect sales or form submissions or actual money makingconversions here.Say you're a relatively new product, or there's a new market and people aren't really searching forwhat you offer, then demand Gen might be a very positive and powerful campaign type, because you'relooking to get a message with imagery and video in front of as many people as possible.So if you're stuck in a if you have a market where people are not, there's not a huge amount of searchvolume for that product.Demand gen using YouTube, discovery and Gmail where you're not waiting for somebody to search, you'regetting in front of them with what we call disruptive media.Disruptive advertising, and you're going to try to appeal to them and say, hey, come check us out.This is why meta, like ultimately meta is a really good example of disruptive advertising.You're you're not waiting for somebody to ask permission for a message.When somebody goes to Google and searches for a product that's permission based marketing.It's like, okay, I'm searching for this.Show me the results.Whereas if you're scrolling on Instagram, you're sort of just scrolling through lifestyle photographyand posts from your friends and the accounts that you follow, and all of a sudden an ad pops up, hopefullyfor something relevant.So that's demand.Gen standard shopping is an e-commerce specific campaign type.So if you sell goods, if you have a checkout, if you sell physical goods, and there's a checkoutpage and a cart function on your website, these are product ads on Google Search and Shopping tab.So if you do a Google search for a product, you'll see ads with images and prices.Those are shopping results.And if you go to the shopping tab on the Google results page, you will also see sponsored shoppingresults.This is a special specially reserved inventory and a special campaign type specifically for e-commercebusinesses.And if you are an e-commerce business standard, shopping is an absolute must.Pmax being your your number two most powerful, uh, driver of actual sales.So when you're focusing on a product for visibility, where again, you're capitalizing on commercialintent, that's when you want to be using standard shopping display.Display is a general term for banner ads on the Google Display network.So you're going to be reaching tens and tens and tens of millions of potential websites and apps.This is called a display network.If you're reading an article on Forbes magazine or Forbes.com and you see pop up banners on the side,if you're on Rotten Tomatoes and you're reading a a movie review and you see these large banners poppingup and ads all over the page, the things that make the internet really suck.The things that make the internet really ugly.The things that make the internet run really slowly.The things that make it really hard for you to read an article.Those are display ads.You want to avoid them in most cases.Look, there's there are there are instances.And we have clients that run a lot of display advertising.But that's, that's it's not for everybody.Those are clients who are running extremely powerful search campaigns and remarketing campaigns.And we understand that just all of these additional impressions is having a positive, incremental impacton sales.But for most of you, in most cases, just putting banner ads out on the internet, even if you're targetingspecific audiences, is not going to be effective.Many people have ad blockers installed on their Chrome browsers, and those who don't are relativelyblind.Banner blindness is a term that refers to the fact that very few people want to engage with these veryannoying types of ads.Video is another ad type within Google.These are videos on YouTube.As it sounds very simple.This is a a a placement, a campaign type that really focuses on getting your message on the YouTubeplatform.There are many different types of YouTube ad placements and ways to structure your YouTube campaign,and we will talk about those in more detail.And of course, the objective is if you want to engage users with your content on YouTube, for example,we put out a lot of training content and we put that content on YouTube.Clients that have testimonials of ours, testimonial videos, how to videos, whiteboard videos, animatedvideos, explainer videos, um, Wix and Squarespace are two great examples who have done very, veryeffective and good work with with YouTube demand gen awareness driven campaigns.And and just as a quick tip, when you're creating YouTube video campaigns, you want to make sure thatwithin the first 3 to 5 seconds your message is getting across clearly, or the video the narrative,the storytelling is so impactful that people want to watch it.And finally, we have app campaigns.App campaigns are campaigns that promote your app across Google's networks.So the ads appear on Google Search, in the Play Store, on YouTube, on the display Network.And the specific purpose of this campaign type is to promote app downloads and in-app engagement.So Google has their own separate analytics infrastructure for measuring in-app engagement, and theapp campaign type is used very specifically.If you're somebody with an app and your campaign goal is to get people to download that app, that'swhen you would use app campaigns.So let's break down the results quickly to give you a visual of search campaigns and each campaign type,just to get a better sense of of how all of this works in the real world.So you do a search on the top, you have those ads.Those are Google search PPC ads below the organic results.That's where SEO works.Search engine optimization is impacted.You have Google ads, PPC searches.Again, the the the sponsored results at the top.Sometimes they say ads, sometimes they say sponsored.Sometimes they say promoted.Google is constantly toying with how they label their ads, but the point is, they look native, meaningGoogle search results.Ads look exactly like or very similar to organic results.And that's for a reason.Google wants the results page just to look like a list of highly relevant results to the user's query.If those results are relevant and the ads sort of blend in as just regular results, Google is goingto make more money because Google gets paid when ads get clicked.Here's what a performance Max campaign looks like in the dashboard.Um, and again, with performance Max you set, you are setting goals.You're telling Google whether you want form submissions or traffic to your site or sales, etc. we'lltake a look at performance Max in more detail when we go and set up a campaign, but it allows Google.It allows the user, the advertiser, to access all of Google's inventory from a single campaign, andit optimizes performance across channels like shopping, YouTube, display, search, discovery andGmail.And most importantly, machine learning and AI are the key words here.P max is going to use machine learning to automate ad placement, bids and targeting, and as far ascontrol over targeting bids and placement, you have much less control over making adjustments to thosesettings in a p max campaign than you otherwise would in a, um, in a shopping campaign or a traditionalsearch campaign.Demand gen campaigns like we like we discussed, are great campaigns.If you don't have a lot of search volume for your product, or you want to augment search volume withrich imagery and video.That's highly targeted messaging to make people aware of what you sell, and to get people to startsearching Google for your brand name or for the products that you sell.We have a we have a list here of examples from demand Gen campaigns.Your ads could show up on YouTube shorts, in-stream YouTube ads.That's when your ad appears before the playing, before the play begins of a video that the user selectedin feed.So if you do a search on YouTube, you're going to get a list of videos that you might want to watch.And in that list, you might get a sponsored result in the discovery app on Google.So for people who use the Discover the Google Discovery app on their phones, your your demand gen videosand images could appear there and in Gmail.So the free for users of Gmail who are not on a business plan, it's subsidized by ads.Those ads, once you open the the the actual email can have an image calls to action and again withwith with demand gen campaigns as they appear in Gmail.Google is going to optimize your headlines and your descriptions to maximize the amount of times thoseemails get opened.And here's your standard shopping campaign.So when you do a search over here for Yellow Vans Old School, we see a long horizontal grid of images,prices, reviews and website names.These are all shopping ads.When you see an image in a price, that's a shopping ad in that format.And below it we see vans official site.That's an example of a text ad.So it's very common for shopping ads and text ads and search ads to appear together on the same exactresult.Sometimes you'll only see shopping ads, sometimes you'll only see text ads.Um, Google is is regularly updating and tweaking how they deliver ads, and that's not something thatadvertisers have any control over.Display campaigns, as we discussed.Um, your banners will appear on sites throughout the internet.These could be GIFs, they could be MP4, they could be images.And again, the thing to remember with with display advertising is it does it can help to to build brandawareness, to attract new customers, to engage existing customers.But remember it's very hard to really drive meaningful awareness with just display advertising.What we have found and what we typically at the agency use display advertising more for primarily isremarketing.So if somebody's been to the site, a quality audience has come to the site through search through demandGen, through YouTube, through SEO or email marketing, whatever the the means of meaningful acquisitionwere will then use dynamic retargeting or standard retargeting with display advertising to keep thatkeep getting more touch points from that same user.And those touch points are much less costly.So whether they're clicking a display ad and coming back to the site, or they're just seeing our brandname regularly as they sort of travel through their purchase funnel.Um, those are some of the more effective ways of leveraging display advertising.When you're looking at display advertising and you're thinking, okay, well, which targeting optionis right for me?So three bullet points to sort of think through what might be most effective.So you want to reach and acquire new relevant customers while meeting your goals.Keep optimized targeting enabled.You don't need to add targeting signals.All right.So that's when you're setting up a display campaign.You're going to have the option to keep optimized targeting enabled.So you want to let Google optimize your targeting because you're just looking to get um, a as broadof a reach as possible.But you want that reach to be targeted towards potential new customers.Now, if you have specific audience segments that you want to reach, you want to reach people who haveeither been on your site for the last 30 days, or you want to reach people who are specifically interestedin certain topics and categories.So then you would add targeting signals to the campaign and keep optimized targeting enabled.Like we talked about in a previous section of this course, there's a whole host of different ways youcould layer targeting signals on top of a campaign.So you could do that for a search campaign, but you could also layer all of those same in-market segments,affinity audiences, and so on inside a display campaign.Now, if you don't want to look for new customers, you could turn off optimized targeting and use yourcurrent data segments.So if you're not looking for Google to find you new audiences that are not on your own data, and youwant to just remarket to people who, for example, have been on your website, then you would turnoff optimize targeting.Optimize targeting just means we'll try to find we'll show your ad to people who are maybe not on yourretargeting list, but we think they're similar to the people on your retargeting list.So if you want to be more specific, and I would recommend doing this as a start, turn off optimizedtargeting run remarketing through display.See how that goes.And if you feel that you could, you're profitable.The campaigns are running well, and you want to give a shot at letting Google discover new audiencesfor you.You can enable optimize targeting later.Video campaigns.Again, these are different ad formats that will all run on the YouTube property, whether it's YouTube'swebsite, YouTube.com, or it's the YouTube app.On a on a on a set top box, on a TV, in a living room, or it's YouTube on a mobile phone, whetherit's YouTube.com or the YouTube mobile app.There are various types of different video formats, such as skippable and non-skippable, in-streamads, bumper ads, and video discovery ads.And we will talk about all of those different ad formats in more detail.App campaigns are also known as UAC.Universal app campaigns, and this is the campaign type that allows that Google, in which Google allowsyou to promote your mobile app specifically across Google's largest properties like the like.Search.Google Play Store, YouTube, and the Google Display Network.Now, the way the differentiator for the the app campaign is instead of manually selecting keywordsor audiences, you provide Google with a a a list of assets like text headlines you want to use, imagesand videos, a budget and a target goal, whether it's installs or in-app actions.So with an app campaign, you could either say, my goal that I want to track is how many times peopleare, how many, how many times are people installing the app on their phones?Or I could optimize the campaigns for people who would install the app and then use it and track thosein-app actions and engagements while a user uses the app.In the next lecture, we're going to dive a little bit deeper into the different campaign types.Now we have a pretty good overview of what all the different campaign types are and their availability,the inventory that they run on.But to get a little bit more strategic sense for each of these individual campaign types, um, comeback in a minute for the next lecture.See you there.
