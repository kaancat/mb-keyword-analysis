# 2.5 Balancing CPC Against Conversion Rate and AOV

When we think about fundamentals, we talk about balancing CPC against conversion rate and AOV.But what does that actually mean?So let's take a look at this chart again five advertisers.They all have their CPC.Now we have associated conversion rates and average order values.Okay.Now these numbers are important because what is constant in this example is everybody gets 1000 clicks.Now we could look at their total spend right.So it's you take their clicks multiplied by their CPC.So for example Advertiser B pays $1.50 on average and has 1000 clicks his cost to Google in this timeperiod.Let's just say this is 30 days or it could be a day.Doesn't matter.It's $1,500.So now we see their total spend.But what about their conversions?The volume of conversions has changed because conversion rate has nothing to do with CPC, at leastnot on its face.Conversion rate is impacted by your site, by your pricing, but all these other factors and not everyoneis going to have the same conversion rate.So Advertiser A, with a 2% conversion rate out of 1000 clicks he gets 20 conversions.But advertiser C with a more expensive CPC with the same 1000 clicks gets 15 conversions.But now look at the total revenue between those two advertisers.Advertiser C generated $1,050, but that's because they had a $70 average order value.They're selling more expensive goods, or their customers tend to buy more of those goods.Advertiser A with a better conversion rate, but a lower price, has a $50 average order value and therefore$1,000 of revenue.But the kicker is Roas.It's not necessarily good or it's not necessarily winning that advertisers see has an extra $50 of revenue.Their return on their investment is actually a losing return.They spent $2,000 on ads and generated $1,000 $1,050 worth of revenue, whereas Advertiser A spent $1,000on on advertising and brought back $1,000 in revenue at a break.Even return on ad spend.Even with a higher conversion rate.The the the thing to to understand here is not any of these individual metrics is a world unto itself.When you look at CPC and you say is it good or bad?It's not a that's not a question.When you look at conversion rate, is it good or bad?It's not a question.When you look at average order value, is it good or bad?It's not a question.It's often very worthwhile to increase your CPC, to go into higher quality auctions to get more expensive,valuable, ready to buy traffic.That increased CPC is likely going to increase your conversion rate a little bit.And if your conversion rate increases more, a greater percentage of that traffic you're buying at thatincreased CPC are going to buy depending on your average order value.Now, right.Because average order value still matters.Because what are they buying and how much are they buying.That's going to generate how many sales you get, your conversion rate, the total traffic cost andyour average order value is going to generate your revenue.And then you take your total revenue over your actual ad spend, and you're going to get your returnon ad spend.And like we just mentioned, lower CPC is not always the goal.Some auctions cost more than others.That's okay.We want campaigns to be as liquid as possible.And this is a concept called liquidity.Liquidity over four key pillars.And it's really important that that you begin approaching your campaigns with this appreciation andthis understanding of what liquidity is.Number one is placement, liquidity, the medium in which the ad is being served.This could include channels like Google versus meta and individual properties within channels like searchfirst YouTube within Google.Audience liquidity.Avoiding demographic restrictions unsupported by statistically significant historic data.And there's always, never such a case unless it's a clear unscalable dimension.What do I mean by that?It's a bunch of fancy words.I've had clients over the years tell me so many times women are never going to buy our products.Kids are never going to buy our products.Over 50 year olds are never going to buy our products.People who live in Wyoming will never buy our products, and they're almost always wrong.Or at least they don't have enough real data or real evidence to support that claim.And if you begin going to Google and saying, we only want you to sell on Mondays, or we only wantyou to bid on men in their 30s, or we only want you to bid on this audience in this location.You're restricting the model from using as much of its learnings as possible.Number three budget liquidity.Using our understanding of your business objectives and then structuring campaigns with the fewest possiblebudget allocation restrictions, that's how you have to begin to think about budget liquidity.Top down budget requirements are not good for performance media.When somebody says, hey, we have $10,000 to spend and that's it.What should be said is we need to see these goals as a minimum.These are the benchmarks.This is the threshold we must cross with profitability or conversion value or new business, whetherit's a volume or it's a margin or it's a growth percentage.And then budget is is unrestricted.So we want to be able to increase and decrease budgets in accordance with performance.And then finally, creative liquidity, um, more so than any other issue that arises with clients isI don't like that ad.I don't like the way it looks.I don't like the color.I don't like that word.I don't like that punctuation mark.Why don't you try this?Why don't you change this hue of yellow?Why don't you try this photo?And it's all preference and look.Fair enough.A business owner, if you're the business owner in this case, or it's a client or it's somebody youwork for, they have a right.They're entitled to putting out ads in the world that they think look nice.And I agree, but you as a practitioner should at least understand the difference between optimizationsthat are going to move the needle.Optimizations that are not going to move the needle, and optimizations that you have to wait untilthe data is in to understand.And the truth is, most of you, including myself, cannot assess two different ads for a product andand accurately predict which one is going to perform better?Say that again because I really feel this very sincerely.I take a lot of pride in creative.I love, I like, I like writing, I like writing ads, I like, I like the challenge of trying to explainsomething in a simple way.Um, and I feel like there are some good best practices to follow with writing ads.However, you will likely never be good enough.You certainly are not good enough.Now to take a look at two ads and accurately predict which one will perform better.Therefore, let the jury of public opinion decide.Well, of course I would modify that if it's really a horrendous.I'm not talking about like a really bad poorly written headline versus a headline that's legible andmakes sense.I'm talking about like minor differences, a B tests the type of things that we see or this pictureversus that picture, this layout versus that layout.And the truth is, if you actually ran good a B tests around layouts and even headlines, colors, images.They rarely do have an impact in an isolated way.Most a b tests that that we run are not actually testing a specific element, like the layout of anad or the the color of an ad, because to do that, you'd have to run, make sure that all of the othervariables remain the same.You'd have to account for any differences in time and location, and it's not so simple, but okay nevertheless.That's the point.Liquidity is an important word for you to understand, and it just means allowing the machine learningthat underpins both Google and Meta to to work and to and to and to do their magic with as little humanrestraints possible.And what's going to separate the really good account managers and the good agencies and the good practitionersfrom the ones who aren't, are the ones who understand where that line is, when I should come in andrestrain the machine, and when I should let the machine do its thing.
