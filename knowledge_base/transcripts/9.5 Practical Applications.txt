# 9.5 Practical Applications

Let's wrap this up with talking about some practical applications.Now, if things are just going awry and they're not working.Reset the I by changing the A's confidence level.This is a new campaign large budgets changes and seasonality bit adjustments.These are three really strong ways of like just a shocking the eye into a new learning phase and justgetting a fresh start.And there's nothing wrong with trying to get that fresh start.In fact we're like one of the most successful tactics that we are seeing right now in a meta campaignthat's been struggling is just wild random budget changes.Now, that might sound really stupid, and it sounds like, oh wow, you guys are silly.You just don't.You just don't know anything and you're just like a monkey.It's actually not true.We understand that part of what might be going wrong is not our keywords.It's not our ads.It's not our landing pages.Might.What might be going wrong is the underlying machine learning having gotten off to a bad start for whateverreason, whether it's overfitting or it's hallucinating too much is just not going to get better.So we're going to kick it into a new, wipe it clean and reset the AI.You could also attempt to remove constraints.So if you're constraining we spoke about those human constraints.If we're constraining the model too much, we're not allowing it to learn in the way it needs to reallylearn.So we could increase target CPA cost caps.We could say, okay, my target CPA was 200.I'm going to allow I'm going to allow you a target CPA of 300.I could decrease my target Roas.So if I if I'm running a campaign where I'm telling Google a target 400% Roas and I'm not getting anytraffic or I'm getting traffic and it's not even close to my Roas, decrease that Roas.Say Google.Hey, you know what?Let's start over.Let's go for a 200% target Roas, or with small budget as a removing of the constraint, we could wecould slowly increase budgets and say, you know what, you could have more data, have more what toplay with.So those are all different ways of potentially resetting the eye when you understand all the differentelements that machine learning is made of, and how difficult it really is to get a model that's stableand a model that's accurately predictive.Accuracy and confidence in AI machine learning are two different things.So for example, if you have a model that's has low accuracy and low confidence, it's going to be likelighting money on fire, right?So it's it's not able to accurately determine, um, where, where that, that, uh, where the bidshould go and what users should see your ads.And when they show the ads to, um, users, it's not confident what's going to happen.And that's when you have a that's, it's it's probably wasteful, but at least it's controlled becausethe low confidence makes it that that you're not spending so much money.Google's not going to overbid so aggressively.But now what happens if you have a low accuracy but high confidence.So that's really bad.That's a really broken model.You're lighting stacks and stacks of money on fire.If you have high accuracy but low confidence then you're making a little bit of money.But if the model is highly accurate and at the same time highly confident, that's when Google is ableto get really, really aggressive and you're making tons of money.You're swimming in gold coins.So we've covered the three key pillars of Google Ads.That's the foundational philosophical key points that you need to understand.I know we haven't spent so much time in the dashboard yet, but we will um, we've talked about understandingthe user.We've talked about understanding costs, and we've talked about understanding machine learning and allof the different associated supporting tools, data points, strategies, ways of thinking about thingsthat, that, that, that are incorporated into each one.And next, we're going to dive into all the different campaign types and specific campaign type strategiesthat you're going to want to consider when building out and optimizing your Google Ads campaigns.Well, I look forward to seeing you there.
