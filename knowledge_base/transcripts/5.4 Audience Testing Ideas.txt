# 5.4 Audience Testing Ideas

Welcome back.And let's talk about a few audience testing ideas.Now, if you want to check out our guide for audience testing for more testing ideas, um, here isa there is a link to the guide, and that link will appear in the slides that you can download to theside here of this lecture module.And there's a lot of really good nuggets and just sort of templates for you to start testing your ownaudience segments.And I really recommend there's a lot we covered here.There's ten different audience targeting tactics.There's tons of different ways you could apply them.There's exclusions.There's targeting.There's observation.Um, it's a whole big component to becoming a more compelling Google Ads practitioner.And I really recommend you digging into this and spending some time and at least beginning to run someof your own tests.But here are a few ideas.Number one customer segment audiences custom segment audiences and Rlsa, remarketing lists and searchads.So you would use a custom segment audiences for a demand gen campaign.So let's say you're trying to generate demand.You're trying to generate traffic to your site.Um, launch a search campaign just targeting specific remarketing audiences.That's an rlsa.So remarketing lists and search ads would be a search campaign using keywords, but you're only showingads in search to people who have been to your site with broad match or dynamic search ads.So use your broad match keywords.Be very cast a wide net.Let Google show your ads to as many different search with for as many different search queries as possible.But you're going to limit the search results.You're going to limit your ads being triggered for just remarketing audiences.So that's one, um, effective way of using audiences.So just keep in mind with this tactic, higher conversion rates must outweigh increased average CPC.So it's very possible that you're going to generate because it's a remarketing audience.It's a higher quality audience.You're bidding on me.You might be bidding on more competitive terms.These are people who might be lower down in the buyer funnel, using queries that are more, that havemore commercial intent in them, and therefore other advertisers will be bidding more aggressively onthem as well.So your average CPC might go up, but make sure that your that the higher conversion rate substantiatesthat increased cost.Um, in this scenario, you like I said, you would expect some higher CPCs because you're going toneed aggressive bidding to bid on your smaller audience of remarketing cookies to stay on top, to stayon top of the search results page.Now, you could test different audiences.For example, we talked about custom affinity custom in-market segments.So you might test help queries like how to query queries that might be a a an audience that you mightwant to go after, people who are looking for more information about a product or a service.Keyword variations by theme.So, for example, your first audience might be best Social Security disability lawyers and your secondaudience might be.Am I eligible for Social Security disability?So you might be looking at people, people who speak differently to Google, and they structure theirquery in different ways, often have different conversion rates, and they're often different stagesof the funnel.So you could create two different custom audiences of people who search for those different queries,and you could observe or you could target and see how those different query cohorts behave and interactwith your ads, what the costs are, what the conversion rates and what the engagement rates are.You might look at short tail versus long tail keywords.Long tail keywords are keywords that tend to have less search volume because they're more specific.They tend to be longer phrases.Short tail keywords are 1 or 2 word queries.They tend to have much higher volume.And you might test two different ad groups, one with these long tail keywords, one with the shorttail keywords.And by combining remarketing audiences or in-market segments, you could see how audience layering ontop of these two different types of keyword strategies impact Campaign performance.One of my favorite ideas is testing different web page types.So you might send one audience to product pages where there's, you know, your typical e-commerce,um, framework.You have products or you have categories, you have an add to cart button.You could write, it's like this is your buying experience, or you could send traffic, even on ane-commerce site, to the help articles, to the FAQ pages, to the blog posts, to the more informationalqueries.And you could gauge and see if I pay less with a higher quality audience to get informational trafficto an informational page.Can I still generate a positive return?And what we found many times with e-commerce clients and e-commerce businesses that by sending cheapertraffic and the traffic, that's information queries that are informational, that are not expressingto Google that I want to buy something tend to be cheaper because fewer advertisers are bidding lessaggressively on those types of searches, and you acquire that traffic for pennies on the dollar, sendthem to an informational site or informational section or informational page on your site.We oftentimes still see higher profit margins, higher Roas from those types of campaigns.But audience layering, by narrowing the scope of the informational queries to people who are in marketor lookalike audiences, is a very effective way to test that strategy with less risk.What are the goals of audience testing?So one is to just identify which audiences are more engaged.And like we said, with observation mode, with any of these audience segments, we'll get really good,rich, real time, accurate data about individual audience segments and whether or not they outperformor underperform campaigns that are not layering on audience targeting.Always focus on conversions first.If you don't have conversion like look like, ultimately we're here to make money.Ultimately we're here to drive sales.So when we're looking at when we're looking at the success or the value of audience targeting.Look at conversions and conversion rate.But if you don't have any conversions or conversion tracking is not set up, which is a big no no.But if you don't have any volume of conversions while you're observing or you're targeting with audiencesegments, use engagement metrics like click through rate, bounce rate, and session duration.Those are excellent proxy metrics that indicate the quality of the user, and you want to align metricswith business goals.So brand awareness is a goal.Lead gen is a goal.But those are different things.So if the goal is lead gen actually getting form fills or phone calls, then make sure when we're observingor we're targeting and we're analyzing the results of layering on different audience targeting, makesure that what we're doing is getting us towards the actual goal.If awareness is the goal of this campaign, obviously the goal at the end of the day for everybody isto make money.Okay, so there's nobody here who's not in this to make a profit, right?So we have to eventually get those form submissions.We have to eventually get those phone calls.We have to eventually get those sales.However, there might be a campaign where the goal of the campaign is to get more people aware of aproduct, or aware of a service, or aware that you exist, in which case you might be looking at sessionduration, bounce rate, you might be looking at, uh, are we seeing an increase in brand search overtime?That would give me an indication that this campaign is working to drive more awareness.So I don't necessarily want to evaluate or kill a campaign if it's not generating a certain amount ofconversions within 30 days, because the goal of a specific a specific campaign might be to generatemore traffic for a down funnel campaign.So it's just a generally important thing, especially when we get into audience targeting, is to alignmetrics with business goals.When you evaluate whether something is working or not working, make sure the variable, the KPIs thatyou're using to evaluate the campaign against is actually a variable or a KPI that measures the businessgoal.Now, in the next lesson, we're going to talk about reaching the right user with the right messaging.It's one of my favorite topics and I look forward to seeing you there.
