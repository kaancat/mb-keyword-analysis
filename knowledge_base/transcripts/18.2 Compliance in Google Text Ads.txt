# 18.2 Compliance in Google Text Ads

How do you allow fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about some compliance items that's worth knowing when it comesto writing your ads, your text ads in Google.So let's talk about some no nos and some compliance techniques.Well, this marker is no good.Let's find see if this one's any better compliance.All right, so I'm back with a better marker.All caps.You're not allowed to have excessive capitalization.Title case is okay.So title case, which is where you capitalize the first letter of every word.Is good and recommended, especially for your headline.So I recommend using title case in your headlines.No cursing, obviously nothing offensive.You know, there's a lot of categories that are, you know, no gambling related products, alcohol,no related.You know, it's not really under cursing necessarily.But these are just products that are not allowed.You can't advertise gambling, alcohol, --, weapons in most cases.And what else?Tobacco.So smoking because e-cigarettes and vaping as well.All right.So those are some things that are not going to be allowed to go in your ads.No extra spaces.Right.You can't do anything that's going to make your ad stand out or look strange just from a visual perspective.So no extra spaces.You can't have any vague calls to action.So, for example, something that just if you just right click here.Right.That's going to get your ad suspended.You're not going to get an ad approved.Click here.That's too vague.They want to be like.Like find out more information on our landing page or call us now to schedule an appointment or checkout our catalog to see our prices.Know like a specific call to action that asks people to do a specific thing that's totally recommendedand actually will increase your click through rate.You always have to have that call to action and we'll talk about having a call to action when we talkabout best practices.Obviously, you can exceed your character limits.If you remember, you have 90 for your description and 30 for your two headlines.Your ads won't get approved if you exceed your character limit.Asterisks, asterisks and symbols.So you shouldn't have too many.You can't have really.I mean, any asterisks usually will be disapproved.Certain symbols are fine.So in fact, one of my best practices is to use.The copyright symbol or a registered symbol in your ads, if it's applicable.Because when you have a trademark term or a registered symbol, it really works.I'll show you an example in a slide.That's coming up, exclamation point.This is something which is oftentimes misunderstood.You could have one exclamation point in the description.Right.Only one in each description and zero exclamation points in your headlines.So no exclamation points in your headlines.And just one more thing on all caps.You can't even have one word in all caps.So if you want to highlight the word free and have it in all caps, Google is not going to prove thatadd repetition.So you might think it's going to be cute for the headline to say something like Sail Sail.It's hard to write down here sail.Right, but that might look cool, but it's not going to get approved.You can't repeat words unnecessarily.Phone numbers is the last compliance technique that is important to know.You can put your phone number in the description or in the headline.If you want to have a phone number again, you have either call only ads or the call extensions thatwe spoke about.So those are some compliance housekeeping items.I want to in the next lecture talk to you about getting your ad reviewed automatically.Whenever you save an ad in Google ads, it's going to go into a review process which could sometimestake a day or two.And it's really frustrating.I know what this feels like.You built out a whole campaign.You're either working for a client, you're working for yourself, and you have these new ads you wantto run.Especially when it's a new campaign, you don't have anything else running and you want to get thatapproved quicker.So I'm going to show you a really cool trick.We're a relatively we're not a huge agency in size, but we're a relatively large agency in terms ofrevenue being managed.And Google gives us a lot of priority support.We're able to get our ads approved really, really quickly.But I'm going to show you a trick to get your ads approved much faster than typical by specificallyasking for a manual review, even when you just save your ads.Of course, if you're blatantly transgressing or ignoring any of these basic compliance rules, thatad is going to not be approved.But even if you have a regular totally fine ad, it still goes into a review process every single time.And in the next lecture, I'm going to show you how to get that ad approved or get those ads approvedfaster.So just be smart with your ads.Focus on good selling techniques.Don't try to do anything gimmicky.Don't try to do anything too salesy.Don't try to do any bait and switch tactics.Google has gotten really, really good at cracking down and if you do get your account suspended, it'svery hard to get it reinstated.We have been successful getting accounts that were suspended or reinstated in the past, but it's noteasy.It takes a long time.There's nothing wrong with getting an ad up, disapproved.That's fine.They'll just tell you this ad is not a one.You have to change it.But that just takes time.Just be smart.Focus on good ads, good selling.What what's unique about your company?And in two lectures, we're going to talk about some best practices.And I'm going to give you a case study for how you could start using your research to improve your adcopy.I will see you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
