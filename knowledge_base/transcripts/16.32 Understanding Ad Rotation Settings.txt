# 16.32 Understanding Ad Rotation Settings

How do Google ads fans and welcome back.In this lecture I'd like to talk to you a little bit about add rotation settings.So without wasting any time, let's jump right back into our Google Ads dashboard under ad rotationin the advanced setting twirl down menu.We're going to open that up and we're presented with four options.You might only be seeing two options in your account because these two options down here are going tobe removed because they're no longer supported.This was a recent change, optimized for conversions, rotate evenly, and we're going to be just leftwith two potential options, which means I could either have Google optimize the rotation of ads andshow the best performing ads, or do not optimize rotate ads indefinitely.Equally to understand and a lot of students sort of struggled with what this really meant, you needto understand the relationship between ads in an ad group.Potential search terms, keywords, etc. and I made a slide to help us understand that.So let's just quickly jump into that and I think you'll have a much better understanding of what thesesettings really mean.So ad delivery and rotation settings.As you know, every ad group can have multiple ads in the aggregate.So in this example, let's say we have four different ads inside an ad group.Now, you also have keywords, right?You have let's say this is an ad group for writing desk.So I have writing desks for sale, discount writing desk, kids writing desk, glass writing desks.And those are all keywords inside that ad, same ad group.So these four ads are at the same level of the organizational hierarchy with, let's say, these 20keywords.Let's say there were 1000 keywords or 50 ads or whatever it was, which means that any of these keywordscould trigger any of the ads in the ad group.Kids writing desks could trigger ad one.It could also trigger ad for at a different time.Desk providers could trigger ad too.There's no way to say, I only want one ad showing for this keyword.That's what ad groups are for.If I want a specific ad to only be shown to a specific keyword or group of keywords, then you needto make an ad group with that ad and that group of keywords that sort of how it works.And just as an example, you might have 5654 search terms for that ad group that could trigger any ofthe keywords based on your max daily budget.So that's the relationship.You have lots of search terms.They trigger your keywords or keyword sugar ads, but the keywords, search terms, ads all operateat the same level of the hierarchy.So when you're choosing your ad rotation settings, you're either telling Google, Listen, if ad oneperforms better, has a better click through rate or has a better conversion rate, if it just performsbetter, then favor that ad.So over time you might log in and see that you might have had, let's say, 1000 clicks right on allthese keywords over here.And AD one got 900 of those clicks, right?Because Google was favoring AD one because it had the best performance.But if you rotate your ads indefinitely, that means regardless of how much better ad one is performingthan AD two or how much better ad for is performing than AD three, each of these ads will get aroundthe same 250 clicks, 250 clicks if we're dealing with 1000 clicks inside the account in general.So that's what ad rotation settings really are.It's do you want to optimize the rotation of the ads or do you want to rotate your ads?Definitely.I recommend always starting out with not optimizing because you don't ever know exactly how Google isoptimizing.If they're optimizing for click through rate.Sometimes certain ads will have a higher conversion rate.And that's not something which which will account for in the optimization that Google does.Google typically will look for click through rate.You also want to learn which messaging works because you could apply that to other areas of your business.Your whole business is not just one ad group.You might be testing a specific offer.You might be testing the idea of scarcity versus reciprocity.You might be testing a specific promotion.You might be setting a traffic to a certain area of the site.And you want to rotate those ads in the beginning to get a sense of which brand messaging works foryour account.So just jumping back into Google ads, I highly recommend not using the default optimize, but clickdo not optimize rotate ads indefinitely and Google gives us that warning.Lower performing ads will run as often as higher performing and so on and so forth.We know that because we just explain exactly how that works.Over time, you might choose to run optimized ads to choose best performing ads, but in most of thecases of the campaigns that we're running, we choose to rotate ads indefinitely, and we make the optimizationdecisions ourselves based on the key performance indicators, the KPIs that we're tracking for any specificclient.So that's the setting that I would strongly suggest you use.But you're not wrong or you're not bad for choosing to optimize.You just get much better information and you have the opportunity to learn a lot more about your business.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about ad schedule, just some concepts in how ad schedulingworks, and I'll see you guys in a couple of seconds in that lecture very soon.Cheers for now, guys.
