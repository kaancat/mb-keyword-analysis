# 4.2 Keywords vs. Queries Terms vs. Negative Keywords

Welcome back.In this lesson we're going to talk about keyword search queries and negative keywords.Just as a primer search query is the actual word or phrase that a user types into the Google searchbar, it represents the real time queries what they're asking Google, for example, women's linen blouse.That's a search query.Keyword.Keyword is the word or phrase that you give Google to use as a guideline when they should trigger yourads to appear.For example, you might have put into Google linen blouse, women's shirts, and when somebody wentto Google and searched for women's linen blouse, Google said, hey, we're going to trigger your keywordthe linen blouse, women's shirts.That keyword is representative enough.It's associated enough with the search for women's linen blouse that we feel that we should show anad.A negative keyword is one way to control and direct how Google matches queries and search terms.Negative keywords are used to exclude specific searches that are irrelevant to the advertiser.For example, you might have put in linen blouse women's shirts.Those could be two keywords that could be one keyword into Google.But Google doesn't know necessarily that you don't sell hats, that you don't sell kids blouses or children'sblouses.So if you don't sell anything for children, you would go to Google and add a negative keyword for children'skids hats, for example.That way, if somebody searches for children's linen blouse, your keyword would not trigger an ad.Google is going to look through your entire list of negative keywords and says, hey, if the searchquery contains any of these search terms or words, we are going to sit out of this auction becauseof that negative keyword.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about keyword match types.
