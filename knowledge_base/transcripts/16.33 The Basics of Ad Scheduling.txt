# 16.33 The Basics of Ad Scheduling

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.Let's briefly talk about ad scheduling.Remember that there's two core component things here, either showing ads or not showing it.That's that binary black and white.Am I showing ads or not?If I'm only open during certain times of the day, you might want to only show ads if you're if you'rerunning a campaign, that's a call only campaign or a campaign that's generating phone calls for a specificor for specific service.And you only service that you only only service customers in that area or location, depending on howyour campaign is broken out.You could choose to run your ads throughout the entire day or throughout or for certain hours.A lot of students and a lot of clients have asked me, well, what do you think we should we run adsall day or should we run ads during certain hours?Well.This.That leads me to the second fundamental part of ad scheduling or what we call de parting, which ismaking bid adjustments the same we want to make.We make bid adjustments based on device or based on demographic group.We can make bid adjustments based on day of the week or hour of the day.Right.And that's a really, really key part to optimizing a Google ads campaign successfully, because you'llusually see different performance metrics at different times of the day, whether you're an e-commercesite or a service business.I would say that in most cases, it's worthwhile to at least bid on good traffic throughout the day.You might say, well, at 1:00 in the morning, no one's going to sign up for my service or buy my product.True, but.At 1:00 in the morning, you're showing an ad to somebody who actually searched for what you offer,right?So if it's a good keyword, it's a good search term.I typically don't see a good argument to not at least bid maybe bid a little bit less.So you could create hour of the day bid adjustments during certain segments of time, chunks of timeto decrease the aggressiveness of your bid or even increase the aggressiveness of your bid if it's duringpeak hours or during time where, you know, sales are more likely to occur.And again, that has to come from your previous data.That has to come from your own historic analysis, from your own understanding of your own business.But quite simply, to add a schedule, you'll go in here.And by default, Google sets these ads to run 24 seven.And I think that's a typically that is a good default because you do want to learn how ads are performingat different hours of the day.Again, if you're just starting off with a campaign, it's really important if you're looking back tosee how campaigns have performed during during different days or different times of the week.That's when you go into those reports.Remember, I showed you the reports inside your Google ads dashboard where you could break out and segmenthour of the day, day of the week, week of the month, etc., even quarter.So to create a custom schedule, I could change all days to Mondays and Fridays, and I might say Mondaysand Fridays we're only going to run ads.We're a local service business and I only want calls between nine and two, let's see, nine and 2:00pm, which is 4:00, 14:00.And I could add, let's say if I want to also do Saturdays, I could do Saturdays between Saturdays,maybe between.11 and one, let's say.So that'll be 13.So I might want to do something like that.So I could have separate and I could add as many schedules as I want.And I recommend playing around with this because over time you're definitely going to want to startcreating some interesting and cool bit adjustments.I want to also show you one more quick thing, which is a tool called Optimizer, and you're going tosee more of Optimizer later on.It's an invaluable tool.Frederick Vallese, who is the CEO of Optimizer, is somebody who I've collaborated with in the past.I write for his blog.He's a fantastic, fantastic guy.I see him at events.But anyway, he has this really cool tool called Hour of the Week analysis, and Optimizer is by farmy favorite PPC software and I don't use much of them like the big ones.I don't really like them, but this is actually really, really insightful and Optimizer actually givesyou some really practical tools.So for example, they give you the hour of the week analysis and they give you this really cool, colorcoded way.I could I could over here select the date range I want to look at.So let's say I want to look at the last four weeks.I could choose which networks I want to analyze, devices I want to analyze, and which campaigns Iwant to analyze, but say I'm analyzing my account.So first at the top, I see a chart that charts throughout Sunday through Sunday over here, impressionsand clicks by default.I could change, I could look, let's say impressions versus conversions, for example.So we'll see conversions and maybe I don't want to have a second one.I can just go up and click none.Or actually, no, I have to have the first one.I could do none over here and I could do conversions and I can see how my conversions have changed andbeen affected at different hours of the day.And I can come down here into this chart and say, Oh, look, 8 to 12 p.m. and 12 to 4 p.m. are the2 to 4 hour chunks of time that are clearly the highest volume for conversions.And I could track conversions versus, let's say, clicks, and I'm seeing that same sort of trend.So I'm seeing conversions and clicks are the best between eight and 8 a.m., 4 p.m..And I can see we have really low volume 8 p.m. to 12 a.m., 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. because it's showing redand I could start making decisions.I can say, well, why am I clicks low?Is it because I'm bidding really conservatively or is it because I'm not bidding aggressively enough?Or is it because the volume is much less?And in this case the answer is because the volume of searches for this product that we're advertisingis much lower during those hours of the day.But let's say you had other competitors during certain hours that were getting more aggressive.This would show you that.And then you would know if I want to capture the market share that I need and I need to increase mybids.And actually with Optimizer, you could actually make those bid adjustments from Optimizer and it sendsthat data back into Google ads.We don't need to cover that now because we're still setting up our first campaign.But the idea is you want to understand scheduling not just as a black and white.I'm not advertising over the middle of the night.I'm advertising there today.No, you could really conceptualize every in my opinion, I would start with 4 hours.So six chunks of 4 hours that makes up a day.Right.And I would look at every day of the week in six chunks of four hour brackets and start there.And once you have your campaign set up in that way, you'll be able to analyze performance based onany of these different brackets and make necessary adjustments.So let me show you quickly what a scheduling report looks like inside a live Google ads account.So here we are in a live account under ad schedule in that section, and we're seeing a color codedversion.This is actually a relatively new tool from Google that shows me some interesting, cool ways to breakdown and visualize how I'm setting up my schedule.So if I if I hover over any given bar on this chart, I see Mons is 12 to 4 p.m..I have a plus 50% bit adjustment.If it's blue, that means I am actually advertising during that time.If it's not, if it's clear or if it's white transparent.I'm not advertising during the time and if you see something yellow, it means that there's some sortof bid adjustment being applied.So from 12 a.m. to 4 p.m., I have a plus 50% bid adjustment, quite aggressive and I see the amountof clicks I've gotten during that time period.I can then hover over to Wednesday's 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. and I can see the amount of clicks and I cansee that there's no bid adjustment applied.And just down below is the breakdown of that actual chart.And this is where I could actually edit these bid adjustments.If I wanted to edit my ad schedule completely, I could click the edit button and over here I couldstart making some edits.So we could see here that Mondays through Fridays we're bidding all day.We're bidding from 0 to 16 and then from 16 to 0, which is the whole day.And I did it.We did it this way so we could add that 50% bit adjustment where we wanted to add it, but say we weregoing to bid from 16 only to 17.And I'm going to find her, let's say 18 and click Save.We're going to see the visualization change a little bit.So Mondays through Fridays, we're now only bidding to 4 p.m. with a bid adjustment and the dark bluemeans it has activity.And then if it's has just an outline, it means there have been no clicks so far.Mondays 4 to 6 p.m. we're bidding with no adjustment and then 6 p.m. and onwards there's nothing there.So I'm going to go back and edit that schedule because that's not what we want to do.We want to do 2000 and I can't type it in, but.0000 great and save.And it's going to go back to how we had it before.So that's a really cool way to set that up.And from this report, I could actually adjust those bit adjustments.So Sunday, all day we see that there's no bid adjustment here.So say I were to say we are not doing well on Sundays.We need to decrease budget.I'm going to decrease by 20% on Sundays and I click save and we'll see that reflected up above.And we see a yellow bar, which means that there's a bit adjustment applied.And if I hover over it, I see that it's now -20%.So I'm just going to remove that by leaving a blank.Or if I just leave a blank, I click save.It'll be nothing.I could also look at my day and our day and our reports.We've seen these before.So I go over today.I see the breakdown of metrics by day of the week and I can download this data and put it into Exceland play with it as I like and change my date range.I could look at this by hour of day, so 3 to 4 p.m., 1 to 2 p.m..If I want to see how many clicks where I'm getting the most, clicks where I'm getting the most conversions.So 12 to 1:00 pm for this account, we're getting the most conversions followed by 11 p.m. to 12 followedby 3 p.m. to 4 p.m..Our cost per conversion are our conversions costing us different amounts of time, different amountsbased on the different time of the day or different day of the week.So it's really, really, really cool reports.Again, just to reiterate, don't think of your scheduling, don't think of your scheduling just asrunning or not running.Think of your scheduling as a constantly changing dynamic in your account.You could always be adjusting and decreasing bids and aggressiveness.My recommendation to you is to run your ads 24 seven unless you have a specific, compelling reasonnot to.If no one's going to be answering the phones and your advertising spend will be less profitable overnight,that's not a reason to not that's not a reason to cut out the spend.It might just be a reason to to bid much, much less per click during those overnight hours.And you do that by have I showed you going into your ad schedule and creating those ad schedules soyou could then make a -60% -70% bid adjustment for overnight hours when you know that the money.Being spent on people coming to your site is not as profitable because it's not going to be servicedas quickly.And then when people are when you have your sales team there or when you're around or when people aremore likely to buy you than increase your bids to get more aggressive throughout the day, you don'tnecessarily have to cut it off.So that is a quick word about scheduling in a nutshell.A quick peek into optimizer.It gets a lot more complex when you're dealing with different types of campaigns.And again, every campaign could have its own schedule.Remember that we're not setting this up for your entire account.You might have 100 campaigns and every single campaign can have its entirely own schedule and it's entirelyown set of bid adjustments.Right.So it's infinite amount of different ways this could play out in your own account, depending on howyou structure your campaigns and all the different elements you optimize.So that's scheduling.I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture where we're going to do a brief discussion about devicetype.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
