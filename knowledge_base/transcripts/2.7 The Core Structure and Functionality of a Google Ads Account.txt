# 2.7 The Core Structure and Functionality of a Google Ads Account

So that's a good primer to to getting started with the Google Ads profit playbook.You now have a very strong understanding of the fundamentals of the Google Ads auction.All the terminology you need to understand why Google is what it is and how to begin thinking aboutliquidity.And some of the some of these more sophisticated ideas, um, that are so relevant to the modern, successfulGoogle Ads practitioner.Welcome to module two, where we're going to talk about the anatomy of a Google Ads account.So don't get overwhelmed by this chart.We're going to break it down.And it's going to be simple.At the top you have your account one email for one account.That's where you set your billing.Whether it's invoices, credit card you set your currency and you set the time zone beneath an account.We have campaigns.Campaigns are containers for ad groups, keywords and ads.At the campaign level you're setting the network.Do you want to run ads on Google?On display traffic, on search partner traffic, where the ads are going to appear?That's those are settings that are configured at the campaign level, locations where your ads are goingto appear.Language, what language your ads are going to appear in, and what language your audience should speakin order for them to see one of the ads in your campaign budgets, you're going to say you're goingto set your daily budgets at the campaign level.Your bid strategies, your ad extensions, and your audience targeting are all configured at the campaignlevel.Beneath campaigns.We have buckets of keywords and ads, and those are called ad groups.And the reason we separate out keywords in a campaign into ad groups is because we want to have thematicallyrelated and relevant keyword themes in the same ad group.Why?Because that will allow us to tailor our ad copy and our landing page to those keywords.So, for example, let's go back to our baseball cap store.We sell baseball caps.Now we sell white baseball caps.We send we sell men's baseball caps.We sell kids baseball caps, we sell trucker caps, we sell embroidered caps.We sell all different types of caps.So baseball caps might get its own keyword.Men's caps might get its own ad group.Baseball caps might get its own ad group.Trucker caps might get its own ad group.Fitted caps might get its own ad group.Because then I can have fitted caps for men.Fitted caps for women.Fitted caps with logos.Black fitted caps.White fitted caps.Washable fitted caps, so on and so forth.All right.So we want to be able to group thematically related search terms and keywords into an ad group.So I might have ad group one in campaign, one ad group one be in campaign in campaign one as well.Each ad group has ads and keywords.Now you can also identify negative keyword opportunities which we're going to talk about in a moment.Keywords are what you're telling Google.As a general rule, giving Google a guide for when to show your ads and keywords are not the same thingas search terms.Search terms are what search terms is the same thing as a query, and search terms and queries are whatthe user actually types into Google.Keywords are what you tell Google in your account that should typically reflect a search term.Now this sounds a little bit confusing and messy because this has to do with match types, and we'regoing to get into match types in a moment.But for example, if I tell Google, my keyword is white baseball caps, Google might use that keywordwhite baseball caps and show an ad for when somebody searches for white baseball caps with Velcro.Even though with Velcro was not in my keyword, Google will see it as relevant enough.Now, I could control that.I could I could add a negative keyword Velcro, and then Google will not show an ad from that keyword.The point is, is we could have a thematically group, a thematically related group of keywords insideone ad group and associated with those with that, with that group of keywords, we have ads, and we'regoing to have a whole bunch of different types of ads.We're going to have responsive ads and text ads.We'll get to that.But ads and keywords go together inside one ad group.So for example, an ad that's in keyword in ad group B will never show for a keyword in ad group A.For every ad, we're going to have landing pages.So we could establish a landing page for all the keywords in an ad group.That which would which would serve as a destination for that thematically related group of keywords.And the second ad group, let's say our first ad group was fitted baseball caps.And our second ad group, our, um, mesh trucker caps, will have a landing page.And the idea of a landing page is, let's send that user to an area of our site or to a search resultspage on our site, or to a collection page on our site that displays the products and the informationthat the keywords in that individual ad group are representing.And again, looking over on the side of the chart, you have campaign two.You have different ad groups.You have keywords and ads in these ad groups and you have different landing pages in each ad group.So just to quickly review, Google Ads account is at the top level of your hierarchy.Inside an account, you're going to have a list of campaigns.There's a million ways we could we could structure campaigns, and every business is going to be different.Do you want to have a campaign for every different category you sell?Do you want to have a campaign for different services?Do you want to have a campaign for different locations?Do you want to have campaigns broken out for all those different things?There's different considerations.And when we get into strategy in a, in a, in a way of understanding how Google's automation works,we'll talk more about how to structure campaigns.But at a high level, just to understand what goes inside a campaign is in order for a campaign to run,it's going to need ads and keywords and a landing page.The landing page is typically associated with an ad itself.We'll see when we get into the actual Google Ads dashboard.Um, how you could assign landing pages to keywords and how you could assign landing pages to ads.It's there's no right or wrong way of doing it.But in order for a campaign to to to serve an impression, it must have an ad group.And that ad group must contain keywords, ads, and a landing page.So here's the core structure and functionality of a Google Ads account.Campaigns.Again, this is just a vocabulary.This is a slide that you could save and you could reference whenever you need.Campaigns are that top level structure.That's where you set your goals, budgets, and an actual strategy.AD groups, subdivisions within campaigns that group related ads and keywords.Keywords are the terms, the words, the sentences, the phrases you target to match your ads with withuser searches.Your ad is the actual content the user sees, including text, images, or videos.It's what the person clicks.It's what the user clicks.Budgets the amount you're willing to spend on a campaign per day.That's your daily budget bid, the amount you're willing to pay for each click or impression, or each100 impressions.Because when you're talking about display, you're typically talking about CPM.I'm sorry.Cost per thousand impressions.Cost per mille.Targeting the criteria used to define who sees your ad, whether that's location, demographics, interests,age groups.When we talk about targeting, it talks about taking okay, we have the whole population of the globe.And we're going to narrow that with targeting.That could say, I'm going to show ads to everybody in the United States of America.Well, you've targeted you've targeted that in the globe.I'm going to show ads to everybody in the United States who is between the ages of 18 and 24.You've targeted.I'm going to show ads to everybody in the United States between 18 and 24 who are interested in, um,coconut shavings.Well, I've targeted extensions.Additional information that's appended to your ad, like phone numbers, links to specific pages, Sitelinkextensions, call extension, structured snippet extensions.Google offers a host of these additional call them boosters to your text ad, which has.We'll talk about the anatomy of a text ad with your headline and description.There's a lot there that you could add to get more real estate and to give more relevant informationto the user.Performance metrics.When we talk about metrics and KPIs, these are data points like clicks, impressions, click throughrate, CTR, and conversions that measure the success of your ads and reports and reports are toolsto analyze and visualize your campaign performance.When we talk about reports, it means going into the reporting section, pulling a chart or table basedon built from the performance metrics, the KPIs that displays the information and analysis that we'relooking for at that given moment in time.And that brings us to the end of module two.Um, now you understand the structure, the hierarchy of a Google Ads account, and now your vocabularyand your understanding of the sort of the core pillars that you're going to be confronted with whencreating your first campaign.You understand what each of those things are.And of course, as we get into it, there's a lot more nuance and a lot more sophistication, but you'llhave a very strong working foundation now to begin building.I'll see you in the next lecture.
