# 10.6 Example Search Campaign Set Up

All right.Welcome back.In this lecture, I'm going to walk you through a template for an easy example search campaign setup.And if you're wondering what about this beautiful hat, you let us know.We'll get you some adventure swag.Okay, so a search campaign is not overly complicated.It's the best campaign on Google.Um, this is where you want to be.This is where you want to live.Search campaigns are your bread and butter.All right.So now that we understand a more complex, interesting, compelling view of the Google Ads ecosystem,especially smart bidding, because that is really the biggest movement over the last ten years.Yeah, there's been tons of different campaign types and strategies.Okay.But the biggest movement over the last decade is smart bidding.That's where you want to really be leaning into.Um, so let's just talk about the, the, the basic campaign setup here.And again, feel free to follow along.Use this as a template.Um, as, as much as you'd like.What is our goal?Of course, you have to establish a goal when you're setting up a campaign.So in this example, drive sales for a high quality outdoor coolers and tumblers website.All right.So this sounds like Yeti.Um, say you're an online retailer and this is your goal.So the first campaign might be non-branded search campaign.So what is non-branded mean.It means that I'm looking for a net new audience.People who are not actively searching for my brand name.So my campaign, my campaign settings might look look like this.The name of the campaign.High performance outdoor gear locations.I'm targeting the United States again.You're going to target whatever country or locations you want to target.Bear in mind, look at your past data.Google is not going to do everything for you.You have to come to the table prepared.Do I ship internationally?Do I get do 80% of my customers come from certain states or locations?What is my budget?Am I starting off with a smaller budget?Maybe I want to focus on just the states or zip codes or locations that historically have have havedone well if my if my website or my products are highly seasonal.So coolers and tumblers sounds like a summer line of products, right?So maybe I want to be bidding on warmer climates.Language English again, customize it based on your campaign needs.My budget.Maybe I'm going to.Maybe I'm going to, um, be bidding $100 a day, but my bidding is going to be maximized.Conversions.Okay, so my baseline strategy is to maximize conversions, um, bidding strategy.So primarily I'm telling Google, get me as many sales as possible, and I might have a Tumblr for $19and I might have a cooler for $400, but I'm telling Google, get me as many conversions with an additional,um, with an additional moderator that says I'm aiming for a 400% target return on ad spend.So for every dollar I spend, I'd like to generate 400%.Back in revenue.But if you can't still maximize my conversions for $100 a day, right?So this is a good setup because I'm telling Google, I want you to spend my $100 a day in the beginning,even if you can't achieve a 400% return.But my goal is a 400% return.Now I have two ad groups.Okay.So my first ad group might might be high performance coolers.My second ad group might be premium insulated tumblers.So for example keywords in the High Performance Coolers campaign, best outdoor coolers, high performancecoolers, durable coolers for camping.And perhaps these are all broad match keywords to begin with because they're pretty specific keywords.And I'm letting Google find me new keywords, right?It's a perfectly good strategy.Seven, six, seven years ago, I would have said this is a bad strategy because broad match is goingto bring in a lot of junk, a lot of bad traffic.But Broad Match is much, much better product today than it used to be.So I.So I would begin this if I'm building this for a client or if I'm building this for myself, I wouldabsolutely begin with a broad match setup.My ads might look like something like headline one top outdoor coolers.Headline two perfect for camping.Discover durable and reliable coolers for your outdoor adventures.Shop now and get free shipping!A strong, clear call to action and the ad headlines are relevant to the keywords in the ad group.That's the key thing to remember.Now, of course, we talked about with responsive search ads, we're going to have 15 different headlinesto write, and we'll get into all of that.But this is just a basic template right.So you want to understand the key ideas that your description includes a clear call to action.Your headlines are relevant to the keywords in the ad group.My second ad group, Premium Insulated Tumblers and my keywords might look like best insulated tumblers,high quality tumblers, long lasting tumblers.Right?So it's again broad match because I'm not just writing tumblers.I'm giving Google some additional qualifiers, some adjectives, some some, some description aboutthe types of tumblers that I sell.AD headline number one, premium insulated tumblers.Number two, a benefit keep drinks colder for longer.Keep drinks cold longer.If you're, you know, have to be creative with character spacing.Find the best tumblers to keep your drinks cold or hot for hours.Order today with special discounts.Again, a clear call to action in the description.Extensions are really important.We talked about all the different types of add extensions, and you want to use as many extensions aspossible.As a general rule of thumb, Sitelink extensions are of the probably most premium, most important extensionto take seriously and to make sure that every single campaign is running styling extensions.So I might have a a Sitelink explorer, outdoor gear URL, non-branded product category page.So for example, there might be a product category page for blankets or for just general outdoor gear.And that could be somebody searching for tumblers, but they want to just see a general page.Google is going to show them a link.It's going to get more space on the Google search engine results page, and I'm going to have a higherchance of getting that click.I'm going to add some call.I'm going to add 3 or 4 more sitelink extensions, call out extensions, free shipping, high durability,outdoor adventure ready, keep drinks cold for 12 hours, so on and so forth.So you want those cold extensions are a little, little small, um, phrases that again add relevantinformation and increase the size of your ad on the page.Structured snippet categories.Coolers.Tumblers.Outdoor gear.Again, if Google if you can give Google that hierarchy through a structured snippet extension, Googleis going to again add more space to the ad, but also it will allow the viewer to better understandwhere this where they're going to go once they click the ad targeting options.Now, I might go into my audiences and select outdoor enthusiasts, campers and hikers.Those are those are categories that Google allows me to select.If I'm starting this campaign, I'm probably going to go into member observation mode.We have targeting mode and observation mode.I don't want to limit my ads because I'm using pretty good keyword targeting already.I don't want to limit my ads just to people who Google considers outdoor enthusiasts, but I would liketo observe and check back in a week or two weeks and see are people who Google also categorizes as campersand hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.Are we seeing a much better conversion rate from this category?Is this a good, high fidelity audience that represents my target market and demographics ages 25 to50 to 50 for higher income brackets.So I'm going to look at my historic data.I understand that 25 to 54 are my key demographic.Maybe I'm only going to target that age group, and maybe if I'm selling more expensive premium gear,I'm going to only be targeting higher income brackets as as Google defines it.So here's a handful of sort of best practices as we as we set up this first search campaign.Keyword match types use a mix of broad phrase and exact match types.Like I said, broad match is great.Definitely use broad match.Don't don't forgo the potential enormous benefits of broad match keywords when you're starting a newcampaign.Because in the campaigns we're running for our clients, some of the highest performing campaigns arecoming from broad match keyword campaigns.Yes, broad match might take a little bit more time to optimize, but to be safe and to be organized,you could use a mix of broad phrase and exact match type for your ad copy.Testing.You got an A, B test different headlines and descriptions to find the highest performing variations.That was part of the game years ago when I got started in this over ten years ago.It's absolutely part of the game today.Test different variations of headlines and descriptions.Negative keywords.Look through your search term, search terms reports I would say once or twice a week in the beginning.Find negative keywords to add to avoid irrelevant clicks.Yes, broad match has gotten a lot better.Know broad match is not perfect phrase.Match is not perfect.Exact match is not perfect.A good, organized, consistent negative keyword strategy will add a lot of hygiene to your account,and it's an important part of your optimization.Schedule conversion tracking huge.Make sure before you launch your campaign that you have proper conversion tracking set up to measureactual campaign performance so you could adjust bids based on actual data.Now I want to say we have we have we have lots of content.We're going to go very deep into actually configuring and setting up conversion tracking.Conversion tracking is a little bit of a pain.It's a little bit of an arduous process.It's a little bit complicated.And it can be frustrating.Frustrating because the conversion data you're going to get in Google is never going to match up perfectlyto what you have in Google Analytics, which is never going to match up perfectly to what you're actuallyseeing on the back end of your site or in your in your CRM.And that's okay.If you're within 10%, 15%, you're okay.But if you're seeing 20, 30% discrepancies in your conversion data, that's a problem.But you cannot aim for perfection because each of these systems tracks conversions differently.Many users who are deleting their cookies and have.And there's a lot of cross-device behaviors that Google might not track.Meta, Google.They're all going to track conversions and differently.They're all going to take credit for conversions differently.Google analytics is going to display that information differently based on attribution models, again,which we will get into in more details as we when we when we in the attribution, um, in the attributioncontent and lectures in the Adventure Academy.But just as a general rule of thumb, you want to make sure that Google's tracking conversions and you'rewithin that 15 to 20% margin of error.Add extensions.Use all relevant.Add extensions to improve visibility and click through rates.This is such a simple thing.I see so many campaigns when we audit campaigns in the in the pitching phase, I see so many campaignsthat are just not using any add extensions.And it's such an easy win because the moment you start adding add extensions, sitelinks, call outs,structured snippets, lead form ads, we generate a higher click through rate and a higher click throughrate gets more traffic to the client's website and results improve.So make sure to take the time to set up your your ad extensions.In the next lecture, we're going to walk through the most common questions we hear at Adventure Mediaget about search campaigns.And I'm excited to go through these questions because you're bound to be thinking some of these questions,and you're bound to be getting some of these questions from your clients.If you're if you're if you find yourself either now or in the future working on optimizing campaignsfor clients.So I look forward to seeing you there in a couple of minutes.
