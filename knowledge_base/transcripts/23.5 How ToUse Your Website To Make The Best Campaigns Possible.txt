# 23.5 How ToUse Your Website To Make The Best Campaigns Possible

So here we have we've added our phone call conversion.We don't do anything.You can you just leave it as is this menu is remains open as we continue to scroll down.I could go ahead and add Lightlink extensions from here by just selecting this box.But we're going to go ahead and at our site like extensions later through the settings tab.So I'll just de-select cyclings I can have a custom schedule set up will be here for when these appsrun I'm not going to do that now.We'll talk about custom scheduling and how to set that up in a future chapter and it could also setmy starting and age for this campaign.For example if I'm going a campaign that's just you know very specific promotion for a certain amountof time a 50 percent off going out of business promotion or liquidating all our file cabinets we mightwant to have a specific date range for our campaigns but because this is going to be a constant ongoingcampaign I'm not going to need to create a start or end date or change the start or end date.And we've seen a lot of these these settings before in the other chapter where we first built our campaign.But it's good to review and this is what the menu looks like it's a tiny bit different.This is what the menu looks like when we're adding a new campaign from an existing account.So once be happy with our settings click save and continue.And once again we're presented with this ad group menu where we do this ad group dialogue where theyare asking us to create our first avenue for this new campaign.I'm going to go down here and cancel new AG group because I want to see what it looks like when there'sno address in an account in how to create an ad group from scratch.So now we have two campaigns in our in our account.We have USA furniture a desk chair and if we click on that campaign we'll see all our ad groups andif once again if we click into an ad group that say I want to go see which keywords and ads are in mycolorful group I could just click on colorful and now I will see my keywords and I'm going to see myads.OK.And I can go get my ads to have keywords and settings for this campaign.Now I want to go down here and scroll down to my new file cabinets campaign.And if we go over to add groups we'll see there's nothing here.You don't have any unable to add groups.Google tells us click plus add grouped above to create one.Which is exactly what we're going to do now.So let's click this plus agrobusiness the button.It looks very similar to the plus campaign.This Button's going to help us is this button is going to be where we create a new Agric.And as you could tell brings us right back to this similar dialog box and we're going to do very similarsort of thing that we did in the first campaign.I'm going to go through every bit of it in detail just because you know how to add a campaign already.Let's just go ahead and create our first group.So file cabinets three door that will be our first Agard to create OK three drawer file cabinets.This is the page we want.So I'm going to copy this for later.This is going to be where this is going to be the destination you are Oliver and we'll name the campaignthree drawer now.We don't need necessarily to name this AG group file cabinets because this is going to be inside ourfile cabinets campaign.That's the that's the benefit of having such a good structure like this.Whenever I go into my campaign and know that these are file cabinet campaigns.So that's good.Another good benefit of having good structure.We're going to keep tech that's elected and now we're going to continue.Now go ahead and write and add and remember all the basic principles that we spoke about last time ofwriting good ads.We want to be appealing.We want to talk about the features and we want to qualify.We want to qualify our traffic with certain elements.Now if you go back to Pop and these are not cheap file cabinets I mean they're not that expensive butthey're definitely mid to higher range.So they're in the two to three hundred dollar range.So we want to try to probably qualify that at some point or we might even want to run a speed test anabsolute test around that.But let's talk about some of the features that pop'n conveys to their customers which is unique highquality and personable and customizable.So let's talk about simply in the headline I want to convey exact what the product is.So let's sayit's a three drawer file cabinets basically takes up most of my a lot of space.So I'm going to leave it like that because that's very clear what we're what we're selling what thispage is going to be about.And what's nice about it is oh I know all my keywords and this cat in this group are going to be focusedon three drawers.So anybody looking for $3 will immediately see an ad that talks to them and talks to their specificneeds.See here customizable.Well you know let's let's let's think about something more feature or rather benefit orientedso we can stay organized.I like that.That's that's really what Poppins likes to convey.Soso I want to include this promotion that they had running three trays and I wasn't able to get thatin there with the different product features that I wanted to.So let's try to do something else.Free trays with purchase and that's try to do a call to action shop now I'm one over.So sometimes I can just you know knock the space out and create that and now I'm perfect.I have one left free trace 3.Can I get three in there.Three free trays with purchase.Now I can't get that in there.I could take away that information point but I think that's the exclamation point in this case is verypowerful.I can I could do three free trays of purchases at a space.I think that's OK.That looks.That looks pretty good and it should go through we shouldn't have a problem.Let's put it in our Morrell's So I just paste it in the actual definition or relic feed it up a littlebit and we'll call this let's say three drawer file cabinets.It's a little too long.I could get it and get rid of the w w w dot at my s.And once again the display Warrell.This is a really great you are ill also because it increases our quality score that shows Google thatit's relevant to what the user searched for.And it also looks to the user that it's exactly the page that they're going to want to go to.So if I if I select if I just click into the final URL it automatically copies my display or album.I could just select all and paste in my actual final you are.OK.So here's my app and I'm and I'm pretty happy with this app and of course we could split the atom andso on and so forth we could add new keywords now but I could also and accumulate I want to show youwhat that looks like and we're going to hit save Haggard.And what happens is Google tells us that they want us to give a default bid.I mean if you see down here so we could set the Keywood level separately but we need a default Max CPCbid for this for this group so we just name it.We'll enter into 2.0 twenty five cents.Save at group and now we have a new campaign with an ad group.But we have no keywords in the ad group in order to add keywords.The ad group we simply click into the ad group and now we're in a key as to how do we use the same bigred button.Plus keywords to go ahead and ask and key words and we have a very simple menu right here where we couldstart adding our keywords.Once again you know this already but we could add the match types we can add the phrase the bracketsthe the the quotation marks.We could also add negative keywords appear as well.So I don't go in here and just add a few phrase match keywords.So now I've created it has a bunch of list of you know this was an off the top of my head.I didn't do any research.But we of course if we were building this were real we would want to do more research like we saw inthe research stage.So I added some phrase match and brought match modified.I added some negative keyword matched a negative match type keywords and let's add a couple exact matchtypes of three drawerand hit save.So now we have a bunch of keywords inside this Hadrat.Now I've noticed you don't see and you know this already you don't see any of the negative cuarto you'reThat's because they're all down here under the negative keywords area in the campaign.Now Google is rolling out currently as we speak.Google is rolling out a new area where you see negative keywords.So by the time you're watching this you might not be senior negative keywords down here.You might be seeing your negative keywords tab up here in this area.They'll be a little button that says negative keywords that will open up the negative.Q Would you have.The point is not to necessarily know exactly where it is on the screen but it's You'll always be ableto find it.The real idea is to know how negative keywords work how important they are how to add them and how toadd them.I could also remove negative keywords by clicking on individual ads.Let's say I want to remove do it yourself DIY I could just simply remove it.Click OK and that it's not an ad group cured anymore.If I wanted to add all these keywords as campaign level keywords and not say I had a whole bunch ithad a whole list I could download these and add grouplet negative keywords.Open them up in Excel and paste them over here and let's do that really quickly.Let's say I had a whole bunch of negative keywords here right so let's say this.This wasn't just 4 it was 400.And I want to add Ms campaign level key which I want to apply these negatives to all the groups in thisentire campaign.I can simply select all download clicked download.Open those up in Excel.Real fast.Grab those keywords copy them and add keywords as campaign level keywords that took just about maybenine seconds and that's a really easy way to add from make at group level keyword negative keywordsinto campaign level and give keywords.And now we have some Q So we've now added the new campaign.So that's really cool.And we're going to obviously want to go in and new add groups if I want to clean up my left hand panelI just click on the icons and if I want to go ahead and add some new AG groups in here I would simplyclick on our file cabinets campaign go to our add groups tab and begin at a new add groups add in keywords.And if I wanted to add a new and maybe split test I simply go over to my AD's tab inside my campaign.Inside this aggregate I'd click on this group to navigate navigate to that ad group and I go click ADDand I have that option that click text add and now they give me the pre populate with my current adand I could go ahead and split test let's say I want to split test.My first line of description I could work you know solid file cabinetsfrom 250 bucks and I click save add.Now I have two ads inside this AG group.OK so whenever we want to add an add add keywords add campaigns and add groups that's always on themthis red button right over here.So you've added a new campaign by going to the all campaigns campaigns just review that the first thingwe did or what I want to pause this so I don't spend any money on it.We've added a new campaign called file cabinets.We then went into that campaign by clicking on it and adding an AD group.We then added one add and we added a second ad to split test by clicking plus add and we also went intothe keywords for this ad group and we had keywords.Now if we click on plus keywords now they're going to ask us.Google's going to ask us to select which group because we're not seeing data at the ADD group levelwe're seeing and as as indicated up here we're seeing data at the campaign level.So if we hit plus keywords we're not going to go we're not going to be able to add keywords yet we'regoing to first have to select which ad group we want to add the key words to now watch what happens.See select an ad group and then it's going to give me an aggregate I can choose from and I could simplyclick through door because that's the only group in this campaign and now I can go ahead and my additionalkeywords.And that's just kind of harkens back to that initial element we spoke about in the previous video isthat whatever you have selected in your left hand menu and whatever is indicated at this breadcrumbmenu up top over here that's that the data you're going to be looking for.If I want to directly add keywords right away to this ad group I'd have to go into the group by clickingon it and then I can go ahead and click add keywords.Same thing for this I wanted to add queries to my mesh AD group.If I clicked on keywords right now I would have to select the mesh group over here.Fine mesh and I could search for it by name.Now I could edit key words or alternatively I could cancel out of that select the mesh Agric from myleft hand panel and then add keywords over here.So that's what we do.So we added keywords we added to ads.We end the campaign and now we're starting to really build out this account.What I need to do is I'm going to go ahead and add a whole bunch of new AG groups for the other forthe other types of file cabinets.You don't need to watch me do that because you know exactly how to add groups what I want you guys todo is whatever but if you're following along in it for a pop in account or if you're following alongfor any other account that you're building for your website.I want you to go ahead and build out some groups.Build out a few more campaigns build out of humor add groups make sure you have at least one ad perhour.I'm sorry Make sure you have at least two ads per ad group.Make sure you have a good 10 to 15 keywords of different match types in each group and put in aboutthree to five campaigns and come up with your own structure for your own company.If you're once again if you're following a line with pop and you could continue doing exactly what I'mdoing here.Follow along with that.But you should definitely get a sense of of how this works and your own and then in the next video you'llsee exactly some of the things that I've done and you can compare and contrast with the way that youstructure your campaign and the way you wrote your ads and added your keywords so I hope this was avery clear.This is a simple video I hope it is clear hope.Now getting a sense of how to expand your account how to continue to ad campaigns and add groups addads and add keywords.Obviously you know how to pause and enable campaigns ad groups ads and keywords in the next video we'regoing to talk about editing campaign settings.That's a very important thing to know how to do campaign settings control a tremendous amount of parametersand they really could drastically affect higher campaign succeed.And how much money or account spends of
