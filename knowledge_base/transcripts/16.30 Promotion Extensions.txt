# 16.30 Promotion Extensions

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about promotion extensions, which is a really exciting form ofextension.We've been using it a ton.And let me show you what it is.We're going to open up promotion extensions.It differs from call out extensions where you could actually run specific deals and links to those deals.And it's really neat.And Google shows them quite a bit.So I'm going to show you just briefly what a promotion extension looks like in the real world.I did a search for picture frames and sure enough, a an ad for one of our clients picture frames dotcom shows up and you see over here on top where I'm going to highlight this in blue is our call outextensions.But below here is a promotion extension.So we have it's a deal.The deal is 20% off picture frames that are $140 plus with an actual code and an end date.Right.So it's pretty neat, a pretty good amount of information.And we get a ton of clicks on these promotion extensions and you will, too, if you use them in theright way.And if I click on this, I don't want to click and cost my client any money, but if you click on this,it will it will lead me to that area of the site that I chose when I set up my extension.If we look down just a little bit further frames by mail competitor, what you're seeing over here wouldpicture frames from 1368.This is a price extension and price extension will cover in the next lecture.And you can see over here some additional information under price extensions, but it's not a specific,specific promotion up here with a usually with a coupon code or something like that is an actual promotionextension.So let's just jump back into Google ads and configure a promotion extension.I'm going to click new promotion extension and I have a few different options.So first, I'm going to choose an occasion.I don't have to choose an occasion.I can leave it as none.But if it's a Black Friday promotion, for example, I should choose Black Friday because Google willdefinitely favor that promotion to show up around Black Friday.So if I chose let's say this is a a Black Friday event, then I would select Black Friday as the category.And I could look at this.There's all sorts of excellent date based, season based, holiday based promotions with Saint NicholasDay, Rosh Hashanah, Passover.Right.Fantastic.My language is English, my currency is US dollars.And then the promotion type is, is it a monetary discount, a certain amount of money off 8% discountor up to a monetary discount or up 2% discount?And you have to be accurate because Google will read the page, the landing page, to make sure thatthat information is there.So if I'm going to choose that the discount is up to 70% off, then they're going to be interested toknow that the landing page indicates that this is a true sale.So say you're going to go back to pop in and we're going to say we're going to pretend go back to officechairs, say this product is the max task.Share is up to 70% offer.Let's say specific color.Let's say let's just say for example, the pool blue is is is 70% off.So I'm going to grab this landing page, the final URL, and I'm going to say the item is max officechair.In blue?No.How about blue?Max chair.Cool blue.Finally Earl Pace that in and I could add promotional details so it might be on orders over a certainamount.So let's say the orders are on orders over a certain amount of dollar value or a promo code.If it's a promo code, you select promo code and you enter in whatever your promo code might be, whateverthat is.And again, you have start and end dates, your options in advance, options that include a preferencefor mobile.And then you have start, date and end dates over here.But this is different than your typical start and end things that we saw before.This is for when the promotion will actually be shown.So it's really cool.So instead of having to update all your ad copy for a Black Friday sale for a Christmas sale, for yoursale or for a rush on a sale, you could have start and end date to this specific promotion, and youcould include that information in the ad.So over here, when I have a start and end date, it includes that in the actual promotion extensiondown here, if you go under advanced options, this is when the extension will actually run up here.The start and end dates is what will show in the actual promotion.So let's say I had a start date of October 24th and it's going to run until November 29, October 29th.I'm like a preview what this looks like, right?And it shows me a Passover sale up to 70% off max chair and pull blue code valid right.This is an incredibly cool extension.It almost sort of creates a semi shopping ad experience attached to a text ad.This is a relatively new form of ad extension.This wasn't available.Was it a year ago or so that these started becoming available?And it's really, really powerful.I think it's my favorite type of promotion to set up because you could have so much interesting information.And of course, these ideas of urgency when the sale is going to end sales, you can say I only havea few left with if it's limited time discount.These are all things that really help sell your products.And of course, promotion discounts tend to work better for e-commerce companies.But even if you're in the lead gen business and you have a service in your service based business,you can come up with discounts, you can come up with different promotions.Maybe you're doing a two for one offer on a specific service.Maybe you're including a free add on service that you typically charge for.This is great for restaurants.It's great for for local service businesses.It's great for travel agents and it's amazing for e-commerce companies.So.That's basically setting up a promotion extension.And again, I could save it and then go ahead and create multiple promotion extensions.So if I wanted to do another extension that I'm offering a monetary discount of $20 off my any filecap any let's a full price cabinet.It's too long.Any full prize draw?Full price cabinets and I would give a final URL for that and I might have on orders over $100.I don't have let's say I don't want to have a start and end date and the occasion might be back to schooland.If I preview, see what it looks like back to school, $20 off full price cabinets on orders over $100.Right.So that's pretty that's pretty neat.I think it's a really powerful promotion extension.You could save it.You have to you have to have a final rule to save it.So I'm going to cancel that for now.And you should use as many of these promotion extensions as you possibly can.But remember remember the hierarchy and how you're laying out your campaigns.The promotion extensions you set up now are going to apply to all the ad groups in the campaign.So if you're setting up promotion extensions at the campaign level, remember that they'll be eligibleto be attached to any ads inside the campaign.If you want to set up, just add specific ad extensions.Then inside the Google ads dashboard, you first navigate to a specific ad group and then you add extensions.You go to the extensions report and you can add a different type of extension or you can go to the campaignlevel, go to add an extension and select that you want to add it to a specific ad group in the in theaccount.And I'll show what that looks like real quick right now.We'll jump back over into a live account and I'm going to go, let's say, into a specific ad groupover here, and I'm going to go and click Add extension, and I can add a promotion extension that willonly be applied to this ad group.As you're seeing over here.Up here, it's only being applied to the ad group.And this all depends.There's no right or wrong.Of course, it's easier to structure things where you're setting up your ad extensions at the campaignlevel so they don't need to redo them and change them for every ad group.But if I'm running an ad group specifically for office chairs, let's say, and I'm and I'm runninga deal, my company is running a deal specifically on office chairs, then you obviously only want apromotion extension that gives you the deals on office chairs to be attached to the office chairs,ad groups.And if I have a filing cabinet promotion that I'm running, I want that to be attached at the aggregatelevel to my file, my filing cabinets, ad group.But if I'm running a campaign for office chairs and each one of the ad groups inside that campaign dealwith different types of office chairs that are all under the same canopy and eligible for that promotion,then I'm really able to just add that promotion extension to the campaign level.And I would recommend, because I think ad extensions are so important when it comes to developing astructure for your campaigns inside an account, think about how you're going to have to deal with extensions.Are you setting things up where you're going to need separate promotion, call out call site extensionsfor every single ad group?Are you structuring things that you could set up these extensions at the campaign level?Because I highly recommend being able to structure things at the campaign level.It'll save you a ton of time and headache and it'll allow you to focus on other things.And when it comes time to changing and editing a campaign or a site link extension or editing a promotionextension, it's much easier and more manageable to do if you're doing it at the campaign level.So those are promotion extensions, really powerful.I would I would recommend as a little bit of an exercise.Try to write out five different potential promotional ideas that you'd be able to use promotion extensionsfor for your campaign.And I think it's a good exercise to start thinking about how you could maybe modify your own offeringa little bit or create a sale or create a promotion for the sake of being able to capitalize on theadditional click rate that you're going to get when you're running these promotional extensions.And of course, you also have quality score benefits as well.Those are promotion extensions.I think that's basically it.It covers promotion extensions.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon at the very next lecture.I thank you for bearing with me.
