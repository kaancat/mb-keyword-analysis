# 13.6 Enhanced Conversions

Welcome back.Let's talk through conversion tracking technique number five enhanced conversions.This is a big one.Enhanced conversions uses extra data like an email or a phone number to improve the accuracy of tracking.Who converts after clicking your ad.Now, with all these privacy regulations and things going on, um, ad blockers, it's much harder totrack users.But if we have an email or a phone number and Google is able to say, oh, this was an email that wekind of had a touchpoint with and ad they clicked on, um, we can match that back.It helps improve the accuracy of tracking people, um, after they clicked your ad.This helps make your ad performance more precise, your data more precise, and keep in mind, enhancedconversions only complement your existing conversion tracking.They add extra data to improve accuracy, not replace your current tracking setup.The benefits of it is that it helps.It can help recover conversions that otherwise wouldn't have been measured necessarily.It depends.You know, maybe for ad blockers or different things improve bidding optimization through better data.So there's more better data to work with.And it's privacy safe with hashing of first party customer data.So you just when you go into the conversion actions, you'll see enhanced conversions.You turn it on and then you can do it through a Google tag and you edit code and it's a little bit morecomplex, but once you set it up, you're good to go.So let's explain how this works.I'm going to get out of here so you guys can see the full story.But enhanced conversions for web.So let's say with consent someone said yes you can.You can send my data to Google.So let's say Sarah, let's take an example.Sarah visits your site, consents to tracking, clicks an ad and makes a purchase.Her email and phone number is hash.That means if anyone would, you know, um, get into that data.It's hashed.You can't.You can't see it.Along with that other conversion details like the purchase amount, the items bought, and the timeof purchase are also sent to Google, improving conversion tracking accuracy.So let's say the Google signs and user views your YouTube ad the user converts on your website.The conversion tag captures the fields you determined.Let's say it was email hashes the data and securely sends it to Google.The hash data is matched against Google, Google's hashed user data, and a conversion is reported inyour account.Now let's just say this all Sarah did not consent.She does not want to be tracking right.When those things pop up, she says, do not accept cookies.Do not, do not.I do not consent to tracking.So she visits your site, does not consent to tracking.Clicks an ad and makes a purchase.Only non-identifiable data is collected.The revenue amount and specific user details are not sent to Google.So Google uses the anonymized and aggregate of the data to model conversions.And we'll talk about this more shortly.But this is what happens when someone doesn't consent to tracking any specific identifiable data isnot sent, and it's anonymized and aggregated.That's enhanced conversions for web.Let's talk about enhanced conversions for leads.This is through offline conversion tracking.We talked about one way with gcloud.Now we're going to talk about enhanced conversion for leads.So you take that same concept of adding in data Adding in identifiable data that's hashed to Googlecan help you, um, track users and track conversions.So unlike the standard version of offline conversion, import enhanced conversions for leads does notrequire you to modify your lead forms or customer relations management.Your CRM system to receive a Google Click ID instead, it uses information that was already capturedabout your leads, like email addresses, um, to measure conversions.So if someone fills out a form, their email address is already in there.So then you're able to send that information through enhanced conversions to to track it and have itmatch to Google's system.And you don't need to use the Google click ID.So this way this works is the user clicks on an ad and arrives on your site.The user browses your site and reads about your products and services.The user fills in a form on your site and becomes a lead for your business.Your website then sends Google hashed lead information.Let's say the hashed email address that you specify.You store the lead information in your CRM database.And then when a lead converts becomes a customer, you upload that hashed lead information to Google,and then Google is able to match the hashed information back to the ad that drove the lead.Okay, so let's talk through an example.John clicks on a real estate ad, fills out a form, and later buys a property after a phone call withyour sales team, his hashed email and purchase details are uploaded to Google Ads, which matches itto his ad click.You and Google can now see which ad lead led to actual sales, even though the final conversion happensoffline.So just so you know, here's where you can get the template.So this is going to be the conversion from clicks.You're going to want to create that conversion action.And this is where you're going to be uploading that enhanced conversions for leads let's say throughthe Google sheet.Give me a moment.Here's what it looks like.So it's very similar to that G cloud template that we showed you.But instead of having the G cloud you're going to have email and phone number, the conversion namethat you want it to go to, the conversion time conversion value conversion currency, add user data,add personalization.Um, that's where you will have this all set up.Um, you can set it up through Google Tag Manager, um, to be able to track that information, thatenhanced lead data.And then you upload it to Google Ads, and then you set it up to associate with your conversion action.So that's enhanced conversions for leads easier than the gold side.But you have to be able to set it all up through Google Tag Manager.I want to quickly show you in Google Tag Manager how to set this up and how to get this user data.So you go here, you create a new tag.You're going to choose a tag type to begin setup, and you're going to do the Google Ads user provideddata event.You're going to put in the conversion ID, which is in your conversion action that you set up user provideddata.You're going to create a new variable, and you can do the automatic collection, which Google automaticallypulls, let's say the name or the email address, or you can do a manual configuration if it's not working.And this would be dynamically pulling in elements from the form or the phone number.So you might need a developer to set that up.You can add in more.You can also do the code and that's where it would be pulling in this user provided data, um, to GoogleAds.Let's say in our case we're going to do the automatic collection.Um.You're going to name it user provided data, save it.Um, that's going to pull in the automatically the information.You're going to trigger it on all pages.And then you save this tag.So now you have your Google tag configured.You're going to want to test it.Um, but then once you have the let's go into the spreadsheet back here for now.So you have your email and phone number.I actually just wrote out, let's say I said adventure PPC.Com my phone number.Let's say I made it up.Okay, now, what's happening here is there's a script running to hash the data.So the way you do that is you go to two extensions.App and script.You're going to you're going to go to triggers.You're going to click Add Trigger.You're going to auto hash it on edit and you're going to save it.And then it's automatically going to hash the data which you see here as soon as I edited it.So then that's the only way Google is going to actually pull this information if it is hashed.So that's how you do, um, Google enhanced conversions for leads with offline tracking.You know, it's very complex, but you guys got this.Reach out if you have any questions.We're here to help.Um, but this is how you set up the Google conversion data for offline conversion tracking.I'll see you on the next lesson.
