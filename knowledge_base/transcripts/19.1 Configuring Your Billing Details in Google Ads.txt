# 19.1 Configuring Your Billing Details in Google Ads

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture we're going to quickly set up our billing because, of course, nothing good in lifecomes free and we have to pay Google for these clicks.So back over here in the computer, this is the page that we land on after we've created our ads andwe understand all about ads.And it used to be that you could go and skip the billing set up when you create your first campaignor account.Google no longer lets you do this, but I'll show you how to get back to billing later on.Two quick things to know.Actually, it's really one quick thing to know.Google will bill you either every 30 days or when your account accrues $500 in clicks, whichever onecomes sooner.So if you're spending $500 every ten days, let's say as an example, you'll get your credit card ordebit card charged every ten days.So let's go ahead and set up our billing information.So we select our billing country.United States, your time zone, your billing country and your time zone cannot be changed after youcreate your account.So make sure to get it right and your time zone is going to effect the reporting in your account.So it matters if you have an introductory offer, you can put it there.Now I selected business for account type it either business or personal.You can switch it to individual or business.And we're going to just enter this information here real quick.By Google default creates an account under the automatic payment system.There is a way to switch that to a line of credit or manager defined spend later on if you're managingthis for multiple clients.Add our credit or debit card.After you add your credit or debit cards, you can click submit.But before you do that, you also have the option of adding a bank account.If you want Google to withdraw the money directly from, let's say, a savings or checking account.I'm going to opt to use a credit card and we click submit.Google redirects us to this page after you set up your billing.Congrats.You're all done.We'll review your campaign usually within an hour after it's approved.You can edit your campaign and check its progress.Let's go ahead and click Explore your campaign.We're going to be brought to the actual Google ads dashboard.We've made it.This is a fantastic accomplishment.We've now created a campaign we understand a huge amount about about Google ads.I would say you guys are in the top 1% of Google ads practitioners already, maybe top 5 to 10%, let'ssay, because we haven't learned scripts and keywords and conversion tracking and attribution modelsyet in audiences.But we will.But this is the Google ads dashboard.I'm very tempted to do a run through of the entire dashboard now and build out our entire campaign becausethat's fun and easy.But I think it's very, very important that we pivot here and we start talking about keywords in depthbecause understanding keywords in depth is going to be incredibly, incredibly important.But I want to show you how to get back to your billing in case you have any questions to get back tobilling, you're going to click tools under setup billing and payments, and this is going to be whereyou could edit your credit card, change your bank account, see what your balance is, etc. Right overhere, it shows how you pay, which shows the active payment profile that I have in place.If I click Manage Payment Methods, I'll be able to add a new credit card, make one default or activeby clicking add payment method or add a bank account or a debit card, etc..I can go over here and see my billing transfers to see when I've been charged.I can see transactions to see if I've gotten any credits back.But of course there are no transactions yet.I go back to my summary.That's the first page we were on, and over here you would see the percentage of threshold.So to start the account, Google actually reduced it for a new account, a $350.I am used to it being $500 in the case of in most cases, if you just make a brand new account, I guessthat that payment threshold will be $350.But don't be surprised if Google changes that, but it's not such a big deal either way.On this overview page, you'll also see your list of transactions, your settings, etc. That is yourbilling area of the account.Obviously, as time goes on, you'll have much more to do here, you'll see, but you're not going tobe there that often.To get back to the overview and where we were before, you click this little back button to the leftof the Google Ads icon, and now we're back to our all campaigns account overview.And it's a beautiful, empty looking dashboard because we don't have any data in it yet.In the next section, we're going to start talking about keywords in a huge amount of detail.It's really, really important.It's fun.If you're a beginner, you might find some of it repetitive so you could skip around.If you're already more advanced, you might find some of the lectures a little bit repetitive or a littlebit obvious to you.So you could, of course, skip around and find the things that you're interested in learning or skipthat section entirely.But if you're a beginner, or even if you'd like a refresher about some interesting keyword ideas,keyword research tools, how to get new ideas, how to organize your keywords in Excel, understandingthematically related groups of keywords.And I suggest you stick around.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.And again, congrats on setting up your very first Google ad campaign.It's a huge accomplishment and I'm very proud of you for now.
