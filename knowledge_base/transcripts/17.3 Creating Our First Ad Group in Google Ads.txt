# 17.3 Creating Our First Ad Group in Google Ads

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.Let's jump back into the Google Ads dashboard and create our first ad group.So here I am.I'm Poppins website.I'm going to start off with my general desk chair ad.But if you remember from that previous slide, which of course you have access to, you can downloadthat was one of the ad groups we wanted to build inside of this campaign and it's Office Chairs campaign.So this ad group will be general.General office chairs, I'll say.And I don't need to indicate the match type in the group name because I'm going to include all matchtypes inside this group.I'm not structuring out my groups by match type, although that's not necessarily a bad idea.We're just not doing it over here.Default bid.Default bid is the amount of money that you're telling Google.I am willing to pay for a click for any of the keywords in this ad group.So long as I don't override that default bid with a keyword level bid.Let me repeat that one more time.Default bid is what your bids will be for any keywords inside the ad group unless they you overridethem either by a lower bid or a higher bid at the keyword level, which you can do.But if I just add a bunch of keywords, all the keywords will inherit the default bid of this ad group.And when I have a campaign built out and I'm making a new ad group, if I don't give a specific defaultbid to an ad group, the ad group will inherit the default bid of what the campaign.Now, what should your default bid be?Well, if you're making a new campaign, it's really hard to know.So I suggest starting between anywhere between two and $4 a click for a default bid, unless you'rein an industry where you know the clicks are very expensive if you're insurance or if you're a hyperlocalservice, or if you're a lawyer or if you're a doctor in health care, then your bids will have to bemuch higher.But again, always err on the side of using a lower default bid than a higher default bid.It's better to spend a few days or a couple of weeks getting too few impressions and getting chargedto little by Google.Then overspending on paying for overpaying for clicks.Let's say if you have really poor quality scores and you're in, you're getting overcharged and you'renot getting the conversions, you're not getting the profitability.So one of the best things you could do is be a little bit conservative when it comes to setting yourdefault bid.So in our case, we're an e-commerce company.I think $3 is a good default bid to go with.Eventually, we're going to be bidding at the keyword level.That's the goal of the campaign to have the right bid for every single keyword in your account.That's ultimately the goal.We're going to understand what our bid has to be by referencing back to our formula sheet where we learnhow to determine what our maximum CPC should be.I'm also going to teach you a few additional formulas for how to determine what your maximum CPC, CPCshould be based on what information you have available to you.But right now we're not trying to determine the exact profitable CPC at the keyword level, we're justgiving a default ad group level bid.And as we optimize this campaign, it's not going to really matter what our default of the bid is,is, is because we're going to always be bidding at the keyword level anyway.Next thing down I must enter in a few keywords and I know that we haven't spoken about keywords yet.And it's going to be a really it's one of my favorite things to talk about.I think it's going to be a fantastic section of this course when we talk about keywords, but we haveto put in some keywords over here.So we'll start off with general office chairs and you do one keyword per line.You could use negative keywords, and I'm not going to go into detail with what negative keywords are.If you know what negative keywords are already, then fantastic.And you could add negative keywords by just putting the minus sign and then using keywords, I'm goingto do minus sign free, which means that any time a person uses the word free in their search term.My ads will not be eligible to show.I could look at Google's keyword ideas in the right hand side over here.So I see office chair.If I click the plus sign, it will add it to my general list.I like that if I click on I don't want computer desk office chair was good.White desk chair.White desk chair is interesting because it has a specific color.Now I might eventually break out my add groups by color, which I probably will, and that would probablybe a good idea.So under this campaign for office chairs, I have task chairs, I have I have rolling chairs.We're going to have high back chairs, executive chairs, leather chairs.But we might also want to have white desk chairs.So I can leave that out for now, because that's not going to go into my general campaign and I scrolldown a little bit more.I don't need to take all the ideas here.I can also enter in a product or service so I can type in office chairs.Instead of using the website.I could remove the website, just type in office chairs and see if Google gives me some more specificideas relevant to office chairs.So computer desk is not really that relevant to office chairs.Now desk chair actually is pretty good.And as she I don't know why I put the word general in there.That was a mistake.That's the name of the ad group.And here we have a few different keywords I want to show you quickly one of my favorite tools, andI'm going to go into more detail with this tool later on.But it's a really fantastic tool called Merge Words.So you go to merge words and it's an invaluable tool.It's totally free and it mixes and matches different keywords.So it's pretty neat.So I could type in, let's say, desk.And I can type in.Um.Next line down.Office.Next line down.Messy desk chairs.Office chairs.Executive.And then I might do something like online by.Sale discounted quality best and then chairs would be, I'd say the one key word because this is allgoing to be about chairs.And I could merge these words in different orders and different combinations with using extra options.And if I click merge, I get an output of all these, I get 24 keywords, right?So I might be able to look through this and say, okay, best chairs is really too broad.It doesn't really indicate what we offer quality chairs as well.Any of the two words I could just remove sale chairs.I might just want to remove something with buy chairs, but I want to keep anything that has desk oroffice in it.So really quickly, I just got a good 21 or so keywords I could copy that, go back to AdWords and simplypaste those all in, which is fantastic, right?So now I have a bunch of keywords inside this ad group using a really nifty tool.I'm going to go back to merge words and some other more advanced tools.When we talk about keywords.Again, using the new ad group menu, I could create a second ad group, but I don't want to do that.I want to make my ad groups.I could create a second ad group right here during while I'm creating my first campaign by clickingnew ad group.But I don't want to do that.I want to create my ad groups.Once I understand more about keywords, once I understand more about structure, once I understand moreabout match types, negative keyword lists, traffic sculpting, all those different things that wetalk about once we get to keywords.So I'm going to X out of that.And just lastly, under traffic estimates, on the right hand in the navigation on the vertical window,Google gives me some estimates.So based on my $50 a day budget, which I gave for the entire campaign, Google tells me, of course,you can get 1500 more clicks if you up your daily budget to $2,910.Thank you very much.Google.I could up my budget to 3000 and get more clicks.I understand.And in my ad group, Google is estimating I'm going to get 27 clicks a day for a dollar 86 average CPC.Those are estimates.They're notoriously inaccurate.But if a client asks you for some estimates, or if your boss asks you for some estimates, you couldshow them.This is what Google estimates, but we'll only know what's actually going to happen when we run campaigns.In the real world, there's just so many different variables that account for changes in performance.So we're going to go ahead and click Save and Continue.We've created our very first ad group and we're going to be brought to the ad creation part of settingup a campaign, which is finally where we're getting into the meat and potatoes of Google ads, salesmanshipand pixels.That's I don't have my salesmanship in pixels mug, but I hope to have my salesmanship in Pixels mugin a future lecture.I had to order a few more, but it's the tagline of our company.There's a whole long story if anybody's interested in the story of how we came up with the tagline Salesmanshipand Pixels.I'll be more than happy to bore you with it.I'm just kidding.I think it's very exciting.And because now we're going to talk about how to sell, now we're going to talk about how to connectto another person psychologically.And this is really where the good marketers distinguish themselves from.The average marketer is, can you sell well?Can you really understand the dynamics of salesmanship?And the real place to do that is with your landing page, your sales copy.But it all starts with showing a person in the initial ad, how you design that ad, how you place thatad.So in the next section of this course, we're going to get into some concepts of writing killer ads,the anatomy of new Google expanded text ads, which is vastly different than how they used to be inthe past.You have more space, you have more headlines, you have more descriptions.It's exciting stuff and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next section where wetalk about writing killer ads.
