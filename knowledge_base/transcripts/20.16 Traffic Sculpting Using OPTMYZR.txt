# 20.16 Traffic Sculpting Using OPTMYZR

How do you relax fans?And welcome back.In this lecture I want to walk you through the traffic sculptor tool in Optimizer.Optimizer is a industry leading PPC performance insight agency software.It could be used for agencies.It could also be used for individual Google ads accounts.I have a good relationship with Fredrick Vallese, the owner of and the founder of Optimizer, and it'sa fantastic software.We've been using it for over four or five years now.They keep on adding to it.It's a really cool software and I highly recommend you checking it out and potentially getting a subscriptionfor your company.Complete disclaimer I do not get paid to promote Optimizer.I'm not an affiliate of Optimizer.I earn no bonus or added benefit from showing you the software.It's totally genuine.We use it.It's the only management software that we use.It's not one of these bid engines like Maureen or can chew.It doesn't manage the campaigns.It gives you additional insights.And I'm going to show you exactly what that looks like over here.So let's jump into the computer and I'm going to show you what the traffic sculptor tool in Optimizerlooks like and how you could use it to your benefit.Here we are on the Optimizer dashboard and this is the traffic sculptor tool and we see a bunch of differentfeatures over here.First of all, we have filtering.We could filter by aggressive or we could filter by other options such as conservative or default.I tend to always keep my filter as aggressive and Optimizer will spit out the most amount of suggestionsfor adding negative keywords.Again, this is.Traffic sculpting.So Optimizer is giving us suggestions of negative keywords to add.At the ad group level, I can choose to d select or select all campaigns or dislike certain campaignsto just get selected, just get suggestions for certain campaigns.But I'm going to look at whatever they have as a suggestion and I'll decide what I want to do.I typically start off with D selecting everything up there at the top.I could, if I want to select all by selecting them again and I'm going to scroll down and take a lookat what's going on here.So over here it shows me campaign long tail frames as we see over here.That's the name of the campaign that I have in AdWords.Right?This is pulling directly from the AdWords dashboard and it's showing me ad group canvas floater frames.And if you remember from the previous lecture, this is quite similar to the example that we gave andthis is actually actually an example.So first they're going to show me a list of search terms that have been appearing for keywords insidethis ad group, my canvas, floater frames, ad group, and obviously going by the title of the ad group.This is a ad group that focuses on canvas floater frames.It's a specific type of frame.We bid a certain amount on that and we send them to the right area of the website.Well, here we see a couple of different search terms that that optimizer is realizing that's beingtriggered by keywords in this ad group that should probably go into different ad groups that are morespecific to it.So frames for canvas painting, frames for canvas prints, wood canvas frames, canvas picture framestretched frames of canvas pictures, frames for canvas panels, frames for canvas art.And what is missing from all these, right, is the word floater.That's the defining theme of this ad group.And these search terms don't have floater in them.So what we would do from a traffic sculpting perspective is want to add these as negatives into thatad group.And so what I could do is add them as negatives into that ad group.So what I'm going to do is select all of these.I like all of these ideas and we can go through, but I'm going to go through one example and at thetop I can click add negative keywords and it's really, really cool.It's going to actually add these as negative keywords at the ad group level.Inside this ad group and Google ads, I'm going to click Add Negative Keywords.And I get I get a notification.Eight negative keywords will be added.I'm going to proceed.We're going, wait a second.And then we get an output of the Changelog and an overview of the changes that have been made.And I can close this out, say I now want to remove those negative keywords from that group.I would have to go back into Google ads.I would have to find those negative keywords that were added to that specific algorithm.Then I could delete those negative keywords from that specific ad group when the time comes.If I'd like to do that, another cool thing is I could take a look at the impressions clicks, clickthe rate cost, average CPC and conversions of the suggested traffic sculpting negative keywords thatoptimizer is giving me.I can do this for any account.I can look at different filters by filtering out search terms that have only a certain amount of impressions,clicks, conversions.I can apply those filters similar to Google ads, and if you're in Optimizer and then you're an accountthat has a lot of suggestions, you might want to use these filters so you could only so you spend lesstime and focus on on the search terms that are most relevant.Let's say they're spending the most amount of money that have less than a certain amount of conversionsor whatever it is to to go and find the most egregious examples of negative keyword sculpting opportunities.So that's sculpting and optimizer.It's super quick.They, they give you these suggestions.They comb through your ad groups based on the keywords in your ad group, based on the ad text, andfind search terms that do not relate exactly to the keywords in your ad group that better relate toother ad groups that exist in your account already.That's the cool thing.They're looking at all the ad groups.They're not going to just tell you a search term that's not related to the keyword in this ad group,if there's no better ad group for it to be in.So it looks to see if a search term from ad group A from this ad group really matches up exactly witha keyword in a different ad group, and it should be triggered by a keyword in that ad group.So it's really, really neat tool and it saves a ton of time.Again, the pricing for Optimizer changes a lot and this is just one of the many, many, many cooltools and available scripts and optimization scheduling platforms that you could use in Optimizer.I'm going to show you more about Optimizer as we go along throughout different sections of the courseand you can get a sense of how cool it is.And then we already talked about how you could do scheduling and optimizer.It's a really neat tool.So check it out.That's traffic sculpting.Like I said in the previous lecture, it's really worthwhile as a good exercise to condition yourself,to understanding traffic, sculpting, using these negative keywords at the ad group level, and gettingyourself in the habit of adding them on a regular basis.Again, not as important as as the consistency that you need with negative keywords, both the negativekeywords that are blatantly wrong for your account, which should be added in the beginning of campaigns.And, and as you're going, as you're going through your optimizations, but also those negative keywordsthat really could be good keywords are just not going to be profitable for you.And of course, one more time, that's as that's so long as you've exhausted the other potential optimizationstrategies to get a good keyword that's slightly not profitable back into profitability because yourjob is not to take the easy way out and just adding a negative keyword that's easy, but to try to figureout ways to get good, good search terms that are just not profitable yet into profitability.And we've learned how to use the search terms report really well with filters, etc..And it's the it's probably the place that you're going to spend the most time in as you're optimizingyour account, negative keywords, your search terms report.That's really what it comes down to.That's really the heartbeat of your entire account.That's what you're spending your money on.And that's also the search terms is getting a sense of how people are really searching for your productsand services and which search terms are triggering, which keywords in which ad groups for how muchmoney at what results, and of course, at what rate of profitability.So that's traffic sculpting.I will see you guys very shortly in the very next lecture.
