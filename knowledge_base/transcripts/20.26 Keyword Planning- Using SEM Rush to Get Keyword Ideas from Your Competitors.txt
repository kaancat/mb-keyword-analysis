# 20.26 Keyword Planning- Using SEM Rush to Get Keyword Ideas from Your Competitors

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.We're going to continue on here with Sam Rush, looking at some keyword research ideas and but now sortof go into how we can get some keyword research ideas from our competitors to get a sense of what theiradvertising footprint has been, what they've been advertising on, and see if we could again have thathealthy respect for the competition and get some good ideas that we might have missed out on from thecompetition.And so some really cool tools here in Sam.Rush, I'm going try to go through them quickly because a lot of this is pretty self-explanatory, butstill very, very helpful.So now we're back here in advertising research.I'm going to start that search again for office chairs real quick.This is what we're working on.The last lecture we said the keyword overview for office chairs.If you remember, we're going go back to phrase match.Look at you.Full report.And we're gonna go back to the the report and the keyword magic tool.And there's a couple of things going on here.Again, 9065 keywords.I don't have any advanced filters on.It's showing sort of everything.Now, if I want to go to a broad match, I can go to broad match.And it's going to jump up to, what, 37,000 keywords?And there's a really cool tool here in some rush where you could toggle from all to questions.And if we remember a few lectures ago, we spoke about how people talk to search engines.A lot of people ask that question directly, and that represents a certain buyer psyche.It represents somebody who's looking for more, who's more likely to be looking for the answer to acertain question.And if you're of course, the answer to a question doesn't necessarily mean a blog blog post.It could be a product.It could mean a service, right?So if you click the word questions over here, you click this button, it'll show you a list of thekeywords that are in question format.So if we see here where to buy office chairs, where to buy office chairs near me, how to clean officechair, how to fix a sinking office chair, how to fix office chair.And and this is a place where you're actually going to get a lot of really good negative keywords,negative keyword ideas.So if we're running an account, a broad match version of office chair, we now know that how to fixor how to repair those would be really good negative keywords that would probably go to the accountirrelevant list.And this is actually one of the biggest mistakes or the things that people really overlook when they'reworking on negative keyword lists is they forget to add these types of informational queries that arespecifically geared towards a person looking for an article or a do it yourself video or service orsomething like that.And most products and services have a lot of their counterpart query based or question based keywordsand search terms that are not relevant to their business.So Pop In does not want to bid on how to fix a leather office chair.Right.So how to disassemble an office chair over here.How to re upholstered an office chair.So these are some really good so re upholsterer would be a great negative keyword and even how to howto as a broad match negative keyword would be fantastic.How to remove hair from an office chair wheels.Right.You see these random random searches that that could cost you money if you get these add clicks forthese search terms.So that's a really good tool to use in as well.Now I want to go back to where I was before, so I click back and go back again.And enter this keyword overview tool.I'm going to type in a domain so we can start off by typing in our own domain.But I'm going to type in one of our competitors in the auction, which is Staples.So I'm going to go to Staples Dotcom and click Enter and it's going to be a domain overview for Staples.Com.Now sometimes you'll see that you're not getting a lot of data and that could be because you've searchedin the keyword overview tool as opposed to the domain overview tool.So up here we could toggle from keyword overview to domain overview.And now I'm going to start seeing a lot more data.So at the very top, we see 422,000 visits through paid traffic.10.3 million visits through organic traffic.18.5 million backlinks.So if you do a lot of SEO research and over here you see some cool stuff, you see that that stapleseems to have been growing in their organic volume, but sort of staying pretty static with their Googleads volume.And again, these are real serious estimates.IV We have a lot of clients that we manage these campaigns for.We know exactly what their volume from Google ads are.And we come in here and we see that either they're seriously undershooting it or seriously overshootingthe traffic estimates.And.Sam Rush So I'm not bashing Sam RUSH It's a great tool, but you have to understand that certain metricsare not reliable, and that's important to understand.It's important to understand, speak to clients.So what are we looking for here?We want to figure out what search terms related to office chairs is Staples bidding on and what percentageof their overall search marketing traffic is coming in through those search terms and through thosekeywords.And we can do that by going down and looking at the page search section.So if we click this 422 K, the number underpaid search, it's going to bring us into a detailed paidsearch report, which we're in now.I could go to the new version, but let's just stay here because I just want to show you the concept.And Rush is always changing how things look.And you could always you could always find what you're looking for.And if it's even if the dashboard looks a little bit different.So I see 71,000 keywords.These are keywords that that Staples is showing ads for.And we see some interesting information.This is the keyword.Whether or not it was an ad, it's an ad.If you hover over the little yellow line, you could actually see what the ad was, which is fantastic,because while this is not what this lecture is about, this is a great way of getting ad copy ideas.If you want to find out what your competitors are doing with ads on certain keywords, you come to thistool in Sam Rush and you could see exactly what their ads have been.So it's really, really neat.Over here you see the traffic percentage, the cost percentage, and that's really the two columns youwant to focus on because you're able to get a sense of how aggressively are they targeting a specifickeyword and how valuable is this keyword to them?If they're spending a good percentage of their costs on a keyword, then that's something which tellsyou that this is a keyword that they rely on and that they've probably been running ads on for quitesome time.If it's a keyword that they have, they're getting a large percentage of their traffic from.Then again, it's a really good keyword to be bidding on and it's probably a good keyword for you tohave in your account as long as it's relevant.So obviously Staples is not a keyword that Pop cares about, which is why we have to go ahead and filter.So we click again by advanced filter and we want to include keyword that contains.And again, if you if you toggle down, you could include or exclude keyword, keyword type, you couldchange the different dimensions that you're filtering.We're going to stick with keyword containing a start off with office.You know what?Let's start off with chair, right?So start off with Chair and see what happens.You could add more filters as we go, but we're going to apply this one for now.So now we're down to around 307 key words as we see here.But I see a lot of these searches have the word staples in them.Staples office chairs.Staple Office Chairs.Staples Chairs.Staples Chairs.Staples chairs.And great, if I'm running a competitor campaign, then these would be some good keywords that I mightexport and have in my competitor account that's targeting staples, right?Absolutely.But let's say I'm not looking to set up a competitor campaign right now.That's not really what I'm what I'm here to do.I'm here to get some new, cute ideas for my general office chair campaigns and start thinking aboutthemes.So I could add another filter in some or so.I'm going to add one more over here under filter.And instead of including, I'm going to exclude keywords that contain staples and I'm going to go aheadand click Apply.Now I'm down to about 183 keywords and now start doing some analysis.So I'm going to make sure I'm filtered by volume, and SMS usually does filter by volume.I probably just went from low to high.So now I'm going from high to low.Office chairs near me.Office chair.Seat cushion.Swivel office chair.Now swivel.That's actually something that I don't think we we had in our list.So swivel office chairs is something that I'm going to select.I'm going to I'm going to bookmark it.I'm going to write it down to my notepad.I'm going to put it down in my Excel spreadsheet.I'm going to jump into our Excel spreadsheet in the next in the next lecture.And there's a few things I want to look at here.So I see the volume estimates.I see that it has more volume than a search for gray office chair, less volume than than a search foroffice chairs and office chairs near me.I see the relative CPC $3.45 estimates.I could see the page that Staples is using for their destination URL for the ads, and I could see thetraffic percentage, the results and the trend.So if I hover over the ad, so say I'm writing ads and I say, Hey, I want to get some ad copy ideawhat staple when when somebody searches for swivel office chairs and staples shows an ad right in Staplesis a company to respect.They're a big company.They've probably been optimizing their campaigns for a long time.We could assume that a good company is a B testing their ads.Let's take a look at their ad copy.So we're going to hover over here.Office chair, staples shop.A selection of office chairs.Yeah, pretty bad ad.So but again, this is an old ad that's not showing the newer formats, etc., but we can still getsome ideas most of the time.You're going to want to come up with your own creative ideas, but you're going to come across competitors.And as you hover over some of these ideas, you're going to see some really cool ideas.You're going to see how good competitors that have been doing this for a long time are using their adsand go ahead and steal, steal ideas.All artists steal.There's nothing wrong with it.That's part of the nature of this game.If you are if you're intelligent enough and you're sophisticated enough to have software where you'reable to sort of spy on your competitors and get a sense of what ad copy has been working for them,by all means, go ahead and use it.If you find a good idea and you think is going to work for you, go ahead and use it.So swivel office chair, best ergonomic chair.Purple desk chair is another one we didn't think of Tempur-Pedic Office Chair It's interesting.That might be a negative word for popping workshop.Chair We haven't thought of workshop, so as you can see.So now all this Google research, the keyword research that we've been doing should be coming together.We looked at related searches, we looked at auto suggest, we asked friends and family.We looked at our competitor websites.We're using the Google keyword tool.We're using Google's internal suggestions.We're using our own intuition.We're using Sam Rush, we're using Uber suggest, we're using Swvl, right?So we're using all these tools.And literally in everyone that we've been to, we found ideas that were not overlaps between these othertools that we found new ideas in every tool that we used.That's why it's so important to not just rely on one tool for your keyword research and your keywordorganization, but to get a sense of your industry.If you're if you're bringing out a new account for a client and this happens to us every single dayhere at Adventure Media, we will be working on an account that we've had for only a few weeks or acouple of months, and we're still there.It's a big business.We're learning the industry and as we look at building out new campaigns and as we jump into these tools,we inevitably see so many ideas that we didn't think of or a different tool might not have, might have,might not have uncovered.And the more you research, the more time you spend on dedicating time for this research, the greaterideas, the more ideas you're going to have.And again, that's the ideas, three sort of categories.You have negative keywords, positive keywords and themes, thematically related groups of keywords,rocking back chair, stationary office chair.And again, these are, these are the keywords that Staples is literally are literally bidding on.And that's why we wanted to take a look at Wayfair.Right?Another company, Wayfair.com, another competitor, huge company, sells a ton of sells a ton of furniture.And I'm going to do wayfair.com and domain overview.Again, 976 even more search terms than Staples, way more search terms and Staples, 42 million organichits.So go ahead and click into the paid search section.I can go in there.I could see that there is around 150,000 keywords tracked and again, I could start doing some advancedfiltering.So I'm going to open up advanced filtering and I'm going to include keyword that contains share.And I'm going to exclude.Keywords that contain free and I'm going to exclude keywords that contain Wayfair.Right.So now we're starting off with what, 150,000 and change and let's see what we come down to when I clickApply.All right, listen, now we're down to 6000, right?So we just knocked out over 140,000 keywords to get to what's relevant to us.And I could go ahead and search sort by volume.It's already sorted by volume.And here we see again gaming chair and gaming chair, something that has come up over and over againas a really, really important negative for us to have in the account.And we already have it desk chair, recliner chair.So some of these are already things that we've been seeing, dining room chairs, interesting computerchairs, zero gravity chair, kids chairs, armchair.Now, a lot of these are good negative keyword ideas as well.Again, you're getting a sense of what other competitors are search, what your competitors are biddingon.And again, you could hover over and see zero gravity.Chair Wayfair zero gravity reclining chair free and speedy delivery.What, what sort of calls to action are they including in their ads?What copy are they including in their ads?It's really, really important.I could also modify my filter at any time, so say I want to get even more specific.I can look at a only search terms that they're bidding on the container office chair and maybe therewill be maybe there won't be that.But let's see what happens.We're we had 6000 keywords before and now we have 346.Now we're down to an actually, we're actually down to a manageable amount of keywords.So I see cheap office chair, white office chair, white office chair.And there we go.White is another important theme we're seeing.White is a a popular search home office chair.Pink Office chair, tufted office chair.Right.Tufted That's something that we didn't think of.Does pop and sell tufted office chairs?Well, if they don't sell tufted office chairs, then we just came up with another great idea for anothernegative keyword.We now have another idea for a great negative keyword that we didn't even get by originally using.Sam Rush Using the keyword overview tool, we have to use the competitive analysis to find tuft it asa negative keyword, and now our account's going to be better for it.The campaigns will be spending less money on this click, and even if any one of these given negativekeywords is not high volume and it's going to be $10, it would have been $10 or $15 or $20 a monthin wasted spend.Still, when you multiply that by by potentially hundreds of really good negative keywords that youdiscover using these tools, you're in a much, much better position.And that money really adds up and the savings really adds up.And two things happen sort of in conjunction with one another.One, the the company or you as the advertiser spend less money on things that won't convert on clicksthat won't convert, and then that money can be allocated.The budget that you have left over could be actually allocated to the keywords in the search terms thatare converting better.Again, this is why keyword research at this phase is so, so important.I want to show you another couple of really quick tools in Sam Rush.If you click competitors under advertising research.It's going to continue on with Wayfair.com because that's the website we were looking at.But this chart over here on the upper right hand corner is really, really neat because it shows youhow you stack up, which is Wayfair.com over here, which has the number of paid keywords around 150K with some of the other competitors and where they're holding in paid search traffic and number ofkeywords.So we see JCPenney up here has a lot more traffic than us and has a lot more paid search keywords,Google ads, keywords.And then you see a bunch of these other competitors here.So, hey, Needle Overstock, how's Jason Main?So I would not necessarily have known this is a great place to come and find who your competitors are.So say we were to come up here and look at Poppin.Dot com and because we want to know like who are our competitors, who are the people that were we'resharing space in the auction with?Who are the people that were going up against?And if we come to this section over here I see poppin it has around an estimated three K keywords inaround 15 K or so, 17 K in paid search traffic.And again, this is something to compare like intra seam rush only within sim.So we can know, we can know with certainty that court has fewer keywords, not that this number of1.5 K is accurate, but we know that it's less than whatever pop in is advertising.So here's some interesting competitors that I might not have known existed.SIMEX dot com It looks like national business furniture dot com up here has a lot more office furnitureto go.So now these are some competitors that I could start researching.So if I scroll down and I say, okay.Office furniture to go has the highest competition level.They have 414 common keywords.I could see the specific keywords that office furniture to go has in common with us.So go ahead and click this 414 number and is going to bring me to a keyword report.With these pre built filters and is going to show me which keywords both we and this competitor advertisingon.So office furniture stores, Oval Office desk, rolling file cabinet, etc. and we could see the resulton the page for a given keyword for each of these companies.So for example, office furniture store is popping and showing one result that might be either be anorganic or a paid result or a Google shopping ad while office furniture go is showing three results.So you see a lot of this interesting data by first looking for a specific competitor and then goinginto the shared keywords.So just to wrap up, Sam Rush is a really, really big tool.There's a lot of cool things that you could do with it.I highly recommend that you get yourself a subscription, at least sign up for the free plan and youcan start getting these ideas.But most importantly, you have keyword research finding negative and keyword positive ideas by lookingat keyword overview reports, getting a sense of competitiveness, getting a sense of estimated cost,comparing keyword to keyword, but then also going into the competitive analysis tool.Take a look at two things in the competitive analysis tool, what your competitors are actually doing,what your competitors are actually bidding on, which keywords in whatever campaign or ad group you'rebuilding, which keywords are bringing in the most or a high degree of their percentage of their overallsearch traffic to their site?What are their what are they spending on?But then also using the competitive tools in some rush to get a sense of who your competitors actuallyare and what paid keywords you both share.And of course, that's only going to be data that that's going to be data that you'll be able to getonce your campaigns have been running for a while.But if a client comes on, this is such a valuable thing to do.If a client comes on, they've been running their AdWords account.The Google ads account for a couple of years, and you can send them a report from CRM that shows them,Hey, your number one competitor, these are the 200 keywords that we're both bidding on together.And we're going to do as best as we can to get a higher place in the auction, to bid more efficiently,to create better landing pages for these keywords, whatever whatever it may be, it's super, superpowerful stuff.So that's Sam Rush.That's how to do some keyword research, some keyword planning in Sam Rush and now we're going to startgetting into keyword organization.We've gotten a lot of our keyword ideas.We have good ideas for themes, but now we're going to bring everything into Excel, and you can dothese in other tools as well.But I'm going to show you how to do it in Excel, because that's sort of my preferred method of whenI'm building out a new campaign from scratch, how we could conceptualize themes, and then how we startworking on math types, modifiers, things like that.So I hope that this has been interesting for you.I hope you now have a good understanding of the value a tool like Rush could provide.And I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of seconds in the very next lecture.
