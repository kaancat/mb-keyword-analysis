# 20.14 Traffic Sculpting- Negative Keywords at the Ad Group Level

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture I want to talk to you about something that we mentioned, but I want to go in more depthcalled traffic.Sculpting.Which is all about adding negative keywords.To add groups no longer to campaigns, not to negative keyword lists.These are necessarily bad keywords where sculpting search terms to go into the right ad group when sometimesthey might be triggering keywords in the wrong ad group.And I'll explain what that means.But first, a few of the benefits of traffic sculpting.One, you ensure that the right bid.Is being applied to the right search terms.If you have certain search terms for your keywords and adverbs, I have a default bid of $5, but youknow that a bit of $2 is the right bit for a certain search term.That's going to be a massive benefit of sculpting.It's it's the number one benefit of sculpting.Second one is you get the most relevant ad copy.Most relevant ad copy.For the search term, and I'll show you some examples of that, and it'll make a lot more sense in asecond.Three When you have most relevant ad copy for the right search term, you get an increase in qualityscore, which in turn decreases your CPC, which in turn decreases your conversion rate, which in turnincreases your ROI.And as you know your ROI Ros return on ad spend.And that's the Holy Grail, that's what we're trying to do.So these are some of the benefits that you get from traffic sculpting.Let's take a look at a couple of different examples where traffic sculpting is really helpful and theseare actually real, real examples.So I'm going to draw a little bit of a graph to make this all make more sense.So first, we have keyword.Let's say call it keyword a and then we have.Ad group.A.Then we have search term.Then we have.Keyword be.Then we have.And Group B, and then we're going to have negative keyword.And we're going to do a couple of examples.I try to make these lines as straight as possible.I'm an abstract artist, so.I can't really draw straight lines.But.This is not too bad.I would get the basic idea.Say, for example, we have a key word.Sofas.For sale.That's a key word in that's keyword.A that keyword is inside an ad group that's labeled sofas.Why?Because that's an ad group that has ad copy that relates to sofas and more importantly, it has a landingpage that sends the users to the page in the website that sells sofas.But because let's say this is a broad match keyword, right?Let's just call this broad match.We go into our search firm's report and we see that it's triggering searches for sectionals.For sale.Now Sectionals for sale is certainly a search term that can be triggered by keyword sofas for sale becauseGoogle would think that they're related.But here's the problem.The ad group that this keyword is appearing in has ads that are for sofa.So the ad copy talks about the sofas we have on sale.The starting price for our sofas, let's say our slightly extensions are called extensions, relateto our sales and promotions and new products related to sofas.And most importantly, it sends people to a page on sofas.If somebody searches for sectionals for sale, they're looking for sectionals.We want them to see an ad with sectionals.We want them to go to the area on our site with sectionals.We're luckily I have another ad group in ad group B, I have another keyword.Sectionals for sale.That appears in an ad group titled Sectionals.All right.And this ad group has ads that are.Talking about our sectionals.Those ads send our traffic to a page on the site that that actually shows all our sectionals and thead callouts and the ad extensions are all referring to our sectionals.But the problem is the search term for sectionals for sale is triggering an ad from this ad group sofas.And I want to avoid that.So simple enough, I would be able to go and add a negative keyword.And this is where the sculpting comes in.I'd make a negative keyword.My negative keyword is sectionals and it's a broad match, negative OC.And instead of applying it to a campaign or negative keyword list, I apply this negative keyword.To add group A to this ADD group, I apply sectionals as a negative keyword to my ADD group for sofas.That way, if anybody if this search happens again.It will not be allowed to go into the sofas ad group triggering from this keyword because it's gettingprevented.Buy this negative keyword, which would then force Google to look for other areas of my account thatwould be eligible to have an ad.And sure enough, I have a keyword sectionals and I have an aggregate sectionals.And it would funnel, it would sculpt, it would sculpt this search term from this ad group and sculptit into my sectionals ad group with the right ad copy with the right ad text, etc..That's the idea of traffic sculpting.You might be wondering and you might be having you might have a very, very good question.And that question might be, why would this even happen if I why do I even need to do this traffic sculpting?If I have an ad for Sophos and I have an ad for sectionals, why would a search from sectionals forsale?Why would Google give give it an impression in the wrong ad group?The answer is that you could never predict all the different variables that are at play.There's time of day.There's the competitive landscape that changes from ad group to ad group.There's different bids.There's live quality score that happens in real time, for whatever the reasons might be.You're never going to know exactly what those reasons are, but you should know that if you have a broadmatch keyword and you have a broad match keyword for a better ad that you know is better, Google willnot always give you the right impression in the right ad group.You have to do the work.You have to do the optimization to make sure the traffic gets sculpted in the right place.Let's take a look at another example.Say, I have a keyword, I'm a local company, I'm a plumber, or I run a plumbing business hire.Plumber.That's the keyword.It's generic, it doesn't really have anything very specific.And I have an ad group and that ad group is, let's say, called Plummer.You know gone for generic doesn't have any like higher plumber's in a location or higher plumber's nearme etc. And now let's say I have a search term.The search term is.Plumbers.Near me.Now, this.This search term shows that a person is looking to hire a local plumber, maybe looking to hire a localplumber faster or whatever it may be.And and Plummer Nearmy is a system that's being triggered by this broad March keyword Higher Plummer.But I don't want that.And I have another ad group and let's say this is I'm bidding lower, right?So let's say this keyword has a max bid of a dollar.Right.But I have another keyword.I have a keyword called.Plumbers.Near me.I have that keyword in an ad group that has a default bid of $5, and the ad group name is local plumber.Okay.Well.The reason why the traffic's coupling here is so important.Maybe the ad is going to the same place, right?Maybe the landing page for ad group B local plumber is the same landing page as local as ad group aplumber generic.But the bids are different.I know that when somebody searches for higher plumber, it's generic.I only want to bid a dollar.My historic data has shown me that's what's profitable.But when somebody searches for plumbers near me, I want them to inherit a $5 bid.And again, the bid is only one component of ad rank, right?So Google might take a look at this $5 bid.They might take a look at this $1 bid and still give you the impression in this ad.I know it doesn't make that much sense, but it absolutely happens.And you'll see this from your own account.So I could do the same thing.I could do some sculpting.So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add the word.Let's say here's my red pen.I'm going to add a couple of negative keywords.I'm going to for this one I'm going to do, let's say, near me.Broad match.Local negative.Broad match.Where am I going to apply these?I'm going to apply near me in local as a negative in ad group A So if anybody searches for near me orlocal, this search term plumbers near me will now have to go into ad group B, inherit my $5 bid.That's another reason for you to do traffic sculpting in such an environment.Even when the landing page between the two aggregates are the same, the bids are different, and Iwant to make sure I'm bidding the right amount for higher quality keywords and I'm bidding less forlower quality keywords.Let's take a look at another product based example, and this is an example that actually came up asas are these all?So say I have a keyword.Picture frames.Online.That's the keyword.The ad group is online picture frames.And the search term that's showing up for this keyword picture frames online is.Black.Floater.Frames.Now because Black Floater Frames is a specific type of frame now, because black floater frames area specific type of frame that's extremely popular.I have a special ad group just for that floater frame.We run special promotions for that specific product.We have a specific page on the site that is that gives a list of our five best selling black floaterframes.We have special call outs.We have different styling extensions for that ad group.And sure enough, we have I'm going to do all four black floater frames.As a keyword in our black.Floater.Ad group.All right.So sure enough, we could do some track sculpting here.And I want to make sure that any single time somebody searches for black floater frames shows up, thisad shows up, an ad from ad group shows up and not an ad from ad group a so I'll ad black.And floater.As negatives in add group A which will then sculpt any time somebody searches for black floater framesinto again ad group B, getting the right ad and sending the traffic to the right place.Let's look at one more example, which is actually location based.So say I have a keyword, I'm a car rental company and my keyword is car rentals.NYC for New York City Car Rentals NYC.That's my keyword and I have a special ad group for.Rentals.NYC, which means my ad in this ad group is going to have NYC and the display IRL.It's going to go to the New York booking page on our site.It's going to talk about special deals we have in New York and might talk about the special.Maybe we have a few different cars available.New York.We have an additional add on limousine chauffeur service to JFK Airport and LaGuardia Airport in NewYork.Right.New York is a really specific ad group.And I want to put my best foot forward and send users to the most specific page on our site when somebodysearches for for rentals in New York.But the search term that's being triggered and this is sort of a reverse example from the last time,say we're having a search term that is something more generic vacation.Car rentals.Now, vacation car rentals doesn't include a.Place.It could be person.It could be somebody booking way in advance.It could be a person who's just doing some research.It doesn't have as much commercial intent.It's not as relevant to me as something like car rentals, NYC.So this is an example that has both components.The ad group is being the ad from that ad group is sending the person to the wrong page and it's alsohaving getting the wrong bid because car rentals NYC, I might be willing to pay $3 for a click, butfor vacation car rentals I only want to pay $2 for a click and it's being sent to the wrong place.But luckily I have another keyword in a different ad group.I have an ad group, I have a vacation rentals keyword, vacation car rentals keyword which exists insidemy vacation.Ad group.Vacations, let's say that's the name of my career.So if I want to make sure that vacation car rentals only goes into this, if I want to make sure thatvacation car rentals only goes into my vacations, add group, I would go ahead and add.Vacations.As an as a broad match negative inside my rentals New York City ad group which would make sure thatany time somebody searches for vacation car rental it would show up, it would show an ad, Google wouldshow an ad for my vacations ad group.Now things would get a little bit trickier.So, for example, let's say I have other keywords in this in this ad group vacation.Rentals.Or vacation car rentals in New York City right now.This is going to be a problem because if I add vacations as a broad match, negative to my rentals,New York City add group.Then when somebody searches for vacation car rental NYC, it's also going to be prevented.So what do I do?Well, remember match types.What I could do is take vacation, car rental.Vacation.Car rental.With brackets make an exact match negative.Now if I add vacation car rental as an exact match negative to my rental in New York City, then anysomebody any time somebody searches for vacation, car rentals without New York City will not show upin my rentals in New York City, add group vacation, car rental, exact match.And if somebody searches for justification, car rental would show up.Now in my vacations add group.But if I don't have a say, let's say I remove that negative.If somebody searches for vacation car rentals NYC, then Google could still show this ad.And if I want to get even more sophisticated, I would go into my ad group.B And what would I do?I would add New York NYC and why New York Manhattan?I would add all these as also negatives to do a dual sculpt so I could sculpt the New York City searchterms away from the Vacations ad group, and I could use exact match negatives vacation car rentalsas negatives in my rentals in New York City.Add group making sure that if somebody just searches for vacation car rentals, it's going to go intothe vacation ad group.And anytime somebody uses New York and Manhattan in their search term, it's going to go into the RentalsNew York City group, even if vacation is included in that term.So if somebody searches for vacation, New York car rentals or New York City car rentals for vacations,I will still get that more aggressive bid in my New York City page because I've decided that out ofthe two modified terms taking vacation and New York, New York is the one that I want to be more relevantfor.New York is the one that I want to service.That's the one that is most meaningful.That's the place on my site that I have a separate section for.I have separate cars, separate deals, whatever it is.Vacation is just maybe, maybe it might be expressing some commercial intent.It might be telling them a little bit higher up in the funnel.But New York City is where I have the differentiating content on my site and in my ad copy and in mybids to really close that sale to be more aggressive with the click.So I use this dual sculpting to make that work.So remember, I know that this got a little bit messy, but I think you guys should understand the conceptof sculpting.Now, in the next lecture, I'm going to walk you through and show you exactly how to add keywords atthe ad group level.And then I'm going to show you an optimizer, a really, really neat tool that's going to show you.And we're going to be doing a few different interesting things and optimizers throughout this course.How to get sculpting ideas based on their algorithm, which is really neat.And then you can create those sculpted negative keyword lists for ad groups really, really quickly,and then we will take it from there.But remember that sculpting is important.It's not as important as your primary job of adding negative keyword lists.It's a secondary negative keyword optimization.Most importantly, I want to make sure that you're adding negative keywords at the campaign level,but it's a really good technique.It's really important to know, and as you get more sophisticated, you're going to see that sculptingat the ad level will incrementally increase the profitability of your account over time.So I hope that makes sense.We will pick this up in a couple of seconds in the very next lecture.
