# 13.3 Primary Conversion Actions

Welcome back conversion tracking technique number two.Primary conversion actions we're going to talk through.Primary conversion actions.Now that you understand what data driven attribution actually is let's talk through.Primary conversion actions.There's primary and there's secondary.So now we're going to talk about primary which is your focus and your main conversion actions that youare optimizing for in your account that you're choosing to um, have the campaign work towards and trackthat goal.So what is a primary conversion action?It's an action that directly contributes to your business objective and generates revenue.A primary conversion action can be a purchase, right?Someone makes the purchase that directly attributes to my revenue and my business objective.I want more purchases.I want more revenue.Um, if it's a lead generation account, it's going to be that whatever that final step is, um, let'ssay they go through a lead cycle.They, they fill out a form.So that can be a primary conversion action.It depends if you're actually sending back that data through offline conversion tracking, which canalso be set as a primary conversion action.So let's say someone fills out a form that happens on the website.That's a that is a conversion action.Let's call it an online conversion action.They fill out a form.Now they go through, um, a lead cycle.So maybe they're marked as a mql SQL and then they're one.Right.Or whatever the process is for any, for any person, um, for any company.So they're marked at those stages.Let's say it's through Salesforce.Let's say that's the CRM they're using.Um, and they that we send that data back to Google Ads.So we have multiple conversion actions.We have the form fill on the site.We have the Mql, the SQL.And then if they actually won the deal now.So let's say someone fills out a form on your site, then there's 100 people that fill out a form onyour site.Then we have an mql there marked as a marketing qualified lead.Now do all 100 people get marked as a marketing qualified lead?I don't know, it depends.It depends if all that traffic was awesome.Um, but let's say all 100 do.Then there's sales qualified lead.That means that the sales team reached out and they qualified them, or they were able to get in touch.Maybe they could only get in touch with 60 of them.So that's 60% of, um, Mqls actually turned into Sqls.Then you have, um, an SQL and then actually one who became a customer on the other end.So maybe of those 60 people, of that 60% of form fills, only 20% actually ended up becoming customers,which is a pretty awesome conversion rate.But you can be tracking Every action that happens.So the form fill the mql, the SQL and the one deal.Now the question is what do you optimize the system for at your campaign level?Are you optimizing for the form fill because you're going to get a ton of form fills?Let's say let's say you have a great business model.You have awesome form.Your form is great.Your landing page is great.Your ads are great.Your search campaign is awesome.You have form fills.Um, or do you also do also or instead of optimize for um and mql or an SQL or a one deal.Right.So then the question becomes which we can talk about in different ways.But um, for a if you have a high volume of, um, of form fills and a high volume of one deals, youcan actually hit somewhat of a benchmarks of 50 conversions a week, then automatically go right foryour ultimate goal.You want to be able to feed the system with your real business outcome, real business objectives.So if you are just optimizing for a form fails, but your lead quality is awful, um, Google is goingto see this information.It's like I'm getting incredible, um, conversion rates and getting people to convert and fill outa form.And my cost per acquisition is really low.This is awesome.I'm going to continue going after that traffic.Right.But then what happens is, is that you get really low lead quality because you're not actually tellingthe system what you actually want, which is I want closed customers.I don't care about form fills.You can give me 5000 form fills, but if no one converts into a customer, if they're really not inmy target audience, don't give me that.It's it's a waste of money.So if you have, um, if you're optimizing and you're telling the system about your, um, ultimatebusiness objective, which is close deals, that's the best way to go.Now, it might cost more money because, um, the conversion rate is lower or expected conversion rateslower.Or it could be it takes time for people to actually close, um, and become closed customers.So that time lapse between a form fill and a closed customer can be two, three, four weeks, whichthen all that data is delayed in the system.So you have to figure out how you want to go about it.Um, there's multiple different ways we'll talk through custom goals where you can actually optimizefor the form, fills the, um, mql SQL and closed one deals.And then you'll be able to view the data, um, by segmenting by conversion action and see what yourcost per acquisition is per stage of the funnel.And then you optimize for, let's say, maximize conversions, which would say, get me as many conversionsas possible.So hypothetically the system should say, ah, this one click got me four conversions.Let me go find more people that actually filled out a form, became an SQL, became an mql and becamea close customer.Versus this other click was just a form fill.They weren't an mql, so I'm not going to try to find more people like that.I'm going to try to go find someone with where one click turns into four conversions.So that's one way to try to train the system and teach the system.But if you do it that way, looking at your cost per acquisition and analyzing the data in the account,it's going to be not a full story and that metric will be inaccurate.Um, but if you have enough data to teach the system with on, you know, your purchase data, thenthat would be ideal or your new customer data.So let's say in the ecommerce example, most people do not, um, optimize for let's say just add tocarts.That's not usually what happens unless there's some, you know, specific strategy around it and you'retrying to I don't know, you could come up with a million examples, but, um, most e-commerce accountsare optimizing and most of their campaigns are optimizing for purchases because that's your ultimatebusiness objective.That's how you're going to generate revenue.So you're going to try to optimize for purchases, um, not add to carts, not initiate checkout.But that's where secondary conversion tracking comes into place.You might still want to track that.So you as an advertiser can know how many add to carts you've had, how many checkout initiated fromthis campaign.Maybe this campaign is generating so many add to carts, but nobody's actually purchasing.Huh?That's a good question to to start to start looking into and try to figure out what's going on.So here's a picture of what it looks like, well, of what it looks like.We'll go into more detail.Um, I'll, I'll open up the account after and show you what a conversion action in the action optimize.But here you'll see there's you can choose either primary action for bidding optimizations or secondaryaction for bidding optimizations.So purchase or a primary action is typically an account default goal, and it will be used to optimizeand report in your conversions column.Um, if you want to see the conversions that you're not are not necessarily what your campaign is specificallyoptimizing for, you can pull up the all conversions column and you can see it there, but we'll talkthrough it more.Um, but you always want to choose a primary conversion action as our campaign goal.That's typically what happens unless you have some different reason.Um, but we talked through primary conversion actions.This is again, very important.You want to teach the system, feed the system with the right data.You want it to have your business objectives.You want it to be reflective of what your team is looking at as a success metric, as a successful rate,um, a successful campaign.So that's generating revenue, getting more customers.All of that.Is your business objective.So you want to be able to track that.So I will see you on the other side.We'll talk through secondary conversion tracking.
