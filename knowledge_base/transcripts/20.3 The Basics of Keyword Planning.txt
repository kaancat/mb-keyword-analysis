# 20.3 The Basics of Keyword Planning

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about the second stage of successful wording.I just coined a word key wording, but I like it.And that's called keyword planning.It's sort of this middle phase between Google, between keyword research and keyword organization andkeyword planning as you're starting to get a more concrete understanding of how your account overallis going to be structured.You've completed your research.You now have a really good understanding of all the potential available keywords and search terms.You have all these different ideas, but everything is still pretty unstructured.You have these top of the funnel ideas, you have peripheral keywords, you have middle of the funnel,bottom of the funnel.You just have a lot of ideas, you've done a lot of research.You understand more about your competition, but things haven't necessarily come together yet.So that stage of planning is where you're going to start getting a better sense of what your final accountor campaign or ad group even.This could all be done at each level of that hierarchy is going to ultimately look like.So let's talk about the different stages of keyword planning in a little bit more detail.So what is keyword planning?You're beginning to map out your keyword bid strategy number one.All right.So now you've done some research you want to start figuring out during the keyword planning stage,this ad group or this campaign is going to be starting off with with this.Bidding strategy, whether it be target CPI, target risk manual, CPC in hand, CPC, that's all partof keyword planning and that's going to change whether you're redoing or restructuring an account thatyou've taken over.I'm going to have an entire section of this course dedicated to auditing an existing account, and ifyou're doing that, you might be switching some ad groups to target CPA.You might be you might have a high performers ad group.Remember, we spoke about that based on the historic data.This is a drastically different process when it's using historic data or when you're starting from scratch,but the concepts are the same.So you might have different bidding strategies that you're going to start putting into place duringyour keyword planning.You're going to start segmenting out your search, your your research, the keywords you've done intotwo different top line buckets, peripheral and target peripheral keywords, like I mentioned in thepast, are these top of the funnel keywords that don't necessarily represent as much buyer intent.For example, if we're selling if we're advertising for office chairs, buy office chairs online, wewould call that a target keyword because it expresses commercial intent.You have a couple of action words in there.You have bar, you have online, you have the item I'm describing.It's a really good bottom of the funnel keyword that's going to be very competitive, but it's clearlyindicating the person who's writing that clearly is indicating that they're looking to buy somethingor at least they're telling us they're in the market for this.Now, peripheral is something like lumbar support at work or my back hurts at work or how to solve backproblems at work.And if we have a section of chairs that do just that, that we sort of market that way, that have betterlumbar support, that help relieve back pain, that's a more peripheral keyword which shouldn't be ignored.It just doesn't necessarily go in the same place in the hierarchy of how you're setting up your account.It's going to have a different bid.It's going to definitely go to different content because what's the distinguishing factor here?What's the main difference between a peripheral and target keyword?I'll give you a second.Target keywords the person or the user is expressing commercial intent to buy peripheral keywords.We do not have any idea of whether or not whether or not the person is in the market.And we need to sort of hedge our bets by bidding lower and sending them to different content to to seeif they are in the market.You might be asking, well, if I don't know if this person is in the market, why pay any money toget them into my store?Well, the answer to that is, and we've answered that before, is because peripheral keywords thathave less commercial intent are also going to be cheaper.So you don't know if a target keyword costs $5 for a click and a peripheral keywords costs $0.60 fora click.It all depends on the conversion rate.So yeah, much, much fewer.The peripheral searches are going to convert.But, you know, no, if a peripheral search will convert at a more even at maybe an even more profitablelevel, because the target searches are much more saturated, therefore much more competitive.Remember, Sergey Brin and Larry Page up in Google in Mountain View are not determining what any keywordsarbitrarily cost.It's the competitors, it's you, it's your competitors, it's poppin, it's Macy's, it's Amazon.It's all the other online retailers that are competing on the same keyword that are determining whatevery single individual keyword search term should cost.So again, you have to test these peripheral keywords.That's how you're going to have an outstanding campaign.If you're just running target keywords, you're going to be the same as everybody else.If you understand how to profitably bid and come up with ideas and organize peripheral, middle, topof the funnel keywords, that's where you're going to be a top 1% or when it comes to Google ads, psychologicalconstructs.You're going to begin to segment out search terms by the buyer funnel and how a person is searching.So you have people who describe their question themselves, right?Like how do I solve my back problem online?They literally talk to search engines with questions.Other people look for specific products.Other people look for model numbers.You're going to start looking at your search terms and using psychological constructs, which we'lltalk about when we talk about the buyers funnel, when we talk about keyword planning in greater detail,when we actually go and do it, you can start understanding your keywords in terms of psychologicalconstructs because why that's going to inform what a bid should look like and what content it's goingto go to as well.And you're going to also begin to understand through keyword planning, how should you start?You can start with everything.And in most cases, unless you have an enormous budget.Remember we spoke about that budget being spread too thin.If you have a $50 a day budget, you really should you really shouldn't have more than ten, 15 keywordsif they're high volume keywords.And everyone hates it.When I say that because they have 500 keywords, they want to run and they don't want to spend morethan $50.Well, you need to pick one of the two.You can't spread a $50 a day budget, over 500 keywords.You're just going to get your data is going to be too thin.And remember, the number one thing that you need to think about when you're launching campaigns oreven if you're restructuring campaigns for a client or for yourself, is am I getting a good, statisticallyrelevant amount of data on a on an ongoing recurring basis?There's no specific rule, but I can tell you that a $50 a day budget should not be spread between 500keywords.So where should you start?You're going to start taking a good amount of these targets because that's really where you want tostart.You want to spend 80% of your budget on the targets and around 20% of your budget on the peripheralkeywords.Because the peripheral keywords, some of them are going to work.Some of them are not.It's research and development, R&D.You're starting to figure out what's going to work and what's not going to work, and you're startingto uncover some golden opportunities for those peripherals.And you probably put 20%, but you've done a lot of keyword research, you have lots of ideas, youhave 30, 40 different potential algorithms built out.But when you start planning, you're going to start getting a very specific sense of how you shouldstart goals.Very similar.Let's just run through this real quick segmenting out keywords by high, low intent.That's going to be a goal.Content planning a word on content planning.We mentioned this.Peripheral keywords need to go to educational content.All right.So if somebody is searching for how to relieve back pain at work, I don't send them to an office chair.I need to make sure that I have content on my website that A talks about that.That gives them an answer to that question in a real informative way.And what I mean real informative way.I mean, don't just spend 10 minutes throwing up a pathetic blog post.You need to have a real, real piece of content that a person who is sincerely searching for answersto that question will really find value in it.And that means either taking the time yourself to do it or hiring a writer.And hiring a writer is one of the best things that you could do for your business if you're runningeven if you're running Google ads, especially since you want to be putting 20% and potentially morethan 20% middle top of the funnel, peripheral keywords that need to go to educational content, becausemost of the time, business owners just don't have the time to write good content, right?Whether or not you can, you have the skills, it's really time consuming.So check out blog Mut, check out Upwork, check out some of these really good websites where you couldhire for relatively inexpensive, talented freelance writers that could put together good content foryour website.So if Poppin was going to advertise for people looking for ways to relieve back problems, they needto have educational content on their website.So that's something to think about whenever you have middle top of the funnel keywords that are notexpressing commercial intent at all, you need to make sure you're sending them to educational content.If you're not, then you're just wasting your money.We have found this over and over again with with e commerce websites that make all their money sellingproducts off their site that we started running PPC ads from peripheral keywords to blog posts and wesaw incredible results.High click the rates because when somebody saw it in the title and the headline of the ad blog post,they know that they weren't being sold.There was no know like sort of get through that defense mechanism of being sold and they go to I'm goingto read a blog or whatever it is.And we saw that the engagement rates and the conversion rates were higher than we expected, sendingpeople to good educational content, target searches.And I want to say Target I mean, bottom of the funnel, people that are expressing commercial intent,people that are expressing that desire to buy something today should go to sales pages.Right.So somebody is looking for buy office furniture online or anything in that category where I'm expressingthat I'd like to buy something, then you send those people to sales pages.So in this keyword planning stage, you need to start evaluating the content on your website and whetheror not you have any educational content ready will help inform you and help you decide where you shouldstart, what your account should look like.Because if you don't have any educational content, then you really should be spending most of yourmoney on bottom of the funnel keywords that have commercial intent.And in most of your industries, there's plenty out there, right?If you're if you're a local business, if you're an Amazon store, if you're an eCommerce store that'snot in a very, very obscure niche, you'll be able to spend plenty of money on target keywords andthen.Again, keyword planning.As you go through more of these tools and you do some competitive analysis, you're going to have aclearer sense of what your who your competition is in those auctions and what they've been doing.Most importantly, you want to start thinking as I segment out, my ad groups buy peripheral bottomof the funnel, top of the funnel keywords as I build out separate campaigns.And again, depending on how your account is structured, you're going to be able to understand whoam I competing with in this campaign?Who am I competing with this and in this campaign?Are they the same companies or are they different companies?And you have tools to analyze that because you're not going to have the same competitive landscape acrossevery single campaign and ad group in your account.And you're going to be able to use the auction insights report and Google ads.I'll show you how to do that to get a sense of who you're overlapping with, who you're competing with.And we did touch very briefly upon some of that stuff when I showed you that script earlier on.In the course tools you're going to be using in the keyword planning stage, you're going to be usingthe Google keyword planner again, you're going to be using Uber suggests Uber.Uber suggests that Oregon's also actually a good tool to use in the keyword research stage.You'll be using Excel Google Docs for pivot tables, organizing, getting a sense of these lists, comingup with thematically related groups of keywords, which we'll talk about in the third.In the next lecture, which is keyword organization Google Sheets, which is the same as Excel but easierspeed, PPC, which is a paid software which is really, really cool.You'll start being able to use speed PPC if you want to build out large campaigns.If you if you have a large ecommerce catalog with over, let's say 20 different product categories,you want to use PPC.I was running campaign for a few years ago for a client that that sells awards and trophies online hundredsand hundreds of categories and we use speed PPC, which is a software that allows you to build out massivegroups of campaigns and groups in the thousands with highly specified ad text, highly thematicallyrelated groups of keywords, and lets you do that at scale quickly.For most of you, it's not worth the cost because you should really learn how to do it within Googleads.And which also leads me to add AdWords editor or Google Ads editor, which is a offline software thatallows that sort of mimics the Google ads dashboard that allows you to potentially build out large campaignsat scale a little bit faster than doing them inside the Google ads interface.But you shouldn't really worry about the AdWords.Google ads editor It's not it's certainly not necessary to cover anything that we're covering in thiscourse.And there's nothing that you could do in the Google ads editor that you can't do online in the GoogleAds interface.Maybe if you're doing some huge amount of work, it'll be a little bit faster to do in the editor,but we're not even going to focus on the editor at all.But if you do want to download that and take a look at what that looks like offline, certainly go aheadand take a look at that.So now you have a good understanding of keyword planning, what the goals of keyword planning are.You're starting you're starting to sort of see how complex putting together a good keyword list reallyis, and it is complex.And once you spend the time doing it, you'll see as you build more campaigns for more clients or asyou build more campaigns for your own company and your own business, it's going to go faster and fasterand easier and easier.And these things will become second nature to you.In the next lecture, we're going to briefly talk about keyword organization.I'm going to run through it real quick because in the future lectures we're going to get into it inmuch more detail.So thanks for bearing with me.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
