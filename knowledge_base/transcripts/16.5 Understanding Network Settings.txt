# 16.5 Understanding Network Settings

Heidi.Google ads fans.And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to pick our first campaign name to build from the pop in website and thenwe're going to talk about network settings.So let's jump right in.Going back to the pop and website, I'm going to drill down, go back to the home page real quick.I'm going to drill down into furniture and I'm going to go into office chairs and stools.Now, my first impression and I'm just walking you through my own thought process as if this was thefirst time I was on this site.Of course it's not.I would maybe say, okay, we'll have a campaign for furniture and I'll have a an ad group for desksand an ad group for fire file cabinets and an ad group for office chairs, etc., etc..But once I drill into office chairs, I see that there's a number of options, even below office chairsI see there's drafting chairs, they're stacking chairs, there's task chairs, there's stools, there'smaybe executive chairs, right?So I feel that there's enough of a segmentation here because these products are quite different becauselet's say I take a look at active seating, right?You have these these this is sort of a new hot topic and you have these these stools.And then I have task chairs, which are very different than I have stacking chairs, which might bebetter for conference rooms or for lunchrooms, etc..And there's a lot of search volume I know from my own research.And we'll talk about keyword research in a future lecture when we talk about keywords.But I know that there's a lot of volume for these different types of chairs, so I want to make surethat I can have a separate ad group for each one of these different types of chairs.So I want to have an ad group for task chairs and an ad group for stools.And if that's the case, I'm going to need to have a campaign just for office chairs.It's not enough for me to have a campaign just for furniture.So I'm going to create my first campaign is going to be for office chairs and stools.I'm just going to call it office chairs.Now, you might be wondering.Well, I could even go further.And this sort of touches upon what we spoke about in the last section.Right.They have red chairs.So I could have a campaign or an ad group.Maybe I want to maybe I want an ad group for red chairs or I want an ad group for metal chairs.Or I want an ad group for chairs of a certain price or chairs of a certain brand.Brand is a tricky one because if there's a lot of search volume for specific brands, then you mightwant to structure your campaigns in a way where you could have ad groups for each specific brand.But in this case, again, going back to that concept of closure, it's totally fine to allow the userto sub select the right product for him.As long as your website is working properly and you have those conventional e-commerce filters if you'rean e-commerce site.In our case, it's it's I think it'll be enough just to send people to the right chair category forthem.And they could also go back up to the higher level if they want to see all office chairs, etc..You want to again, it's there's no right exact rule.You want to basically have a fine balance between giving them, bringing them to the right area of yourof your site, but also allowing them to then have a menu of things and to choose from and to go findthe information they're looking for on their own.It's a really, really important concept.Not only will it not hurt your conversion rate, it will actually increase your conversion rate.So it's important to think about.So going back into AdWords, we're going to name our campaign simply office chairs.Now, just a word about naming conventions.It's really important for you to figure out your own naming conventions because you're going have alot of campaigns, you're going to have a lot of ad groups at our company.We typically do things like AMP for the name of our company, and then maybe we'll do something likeoffice chairs.If we're targeting things by location, I might do USA.If it's a USA only campaign.It all depends on the client.It all depends on how we're structuring the overall account.We'll usually draft out with a diagram, how we want to structure the account, and it's a good ideato get into the practice of doing and then you go go ahead and build the campaigns.But for the sake of this test, we'll just name it office chairs.For now, that's the name of our campaign.The next option we have is to choose networks, search network or display network.And by default.And again, this is one of the things that Google does by default to get you to spend more money.The first thing you want to do is Select Display Network.If you keep Display Network selected, this is what was used to be referred to.For some of you who are not new to Google ads, this used to be called Search Network with Display Select,which meant that I'm going to create ad groups and search ads in my text ads with my headlines and mydescriptions and so on and so forth, and my text links and my all my different ad extensions.And Google will be able to show those ads on the display network.So on all these other websites, the problem is that's not search advertising.Search advertising is being able to capitalize on the user's intent, being able to show an ad to payfor an ad when a user is specifically searching for the products and services that I offer.If I'm showing my ads on the display network, then I'm in a totally different ballgame.Not that that's bad, but don't ever combine the two things.Keep your data clean, keep your data organized.It's such an important concept that you'll see as a continuing thread throughout this course.Keep things organized.It allows you to to analyze your data more efficiently.It allows you to report on your data more effectively.And overall, you'll just have a much more enjoyable and profitable time.Managing your campaigns.And of course, displaying our clicks are never as profitable.I shouldn't say never, but displayed our traffic is usually not as profitable and doesn't convert aswell as search network search network traffic.And I really strongly recommend never having display traffic and search traffic coming in from one campaign.So the first thing we're going to do is de select display network.Now I have the option of de selecting include Google search partners.Now what in the world is this option of Google search partners?Well, let's jump into some slides.I'm going to go through that right now.So search partner network, how to decide.Welcome to the first slide of this course.I think it's the first slide and all my slides are downloadable.And I also want to say to my own credit, I took some time to redo all the slides.My original version of the slides all had a dark background with light text and now it's light backgroundwith dark text to make it easier for you guys to print these slides out if you'd like to.So let's take let's do a quick overview of the search partner network.The search partner network includes sites like YouTube, Amazon, Ask.com, Google Maps, About.com,many, many others.There's no official list.These are sites that have search functionality within them.And there's not just a handful.There's thousands and tens of thousands of sites like this that use Google search functionality in someways in their websites.And there's a range between real legitimate websites like the ones I'm listing above and and just tonsof these random blogs that that also use search functionality.Now the difference between this and the display network, while these are websites outside of Google'sproperty, Google search property, they're not display ads.They are still ads that will be shown when a user performs a specific search.It's still based on keyword targeting.It's totally different than the display network.It's like this sort of medium level.The reason why Google itself is better is because people have more trust in the Google results.An ad means something more in Google search results than it means something in Ask.com or on a randomblog.And you just have.Less of an idea of what a person is thinking or doing when they're searching off of Google.There's a certain way people search on Google that they don't necessarily use the search partner sitesto search for.So if I'm on CNN.com, I might not be in the same mindset of looking for outside information as I mightbe when I'm on Google.com, which is really a big Yellow Pages.Google is a big referral network and other sites might not might not be perceived in the same way.Amazon actually does have ads that are shown on its pages that are sent and placed via the Google searchpartner network.And I'll show you after these slides what that looks like.These ads can also be accessed via Google search bars in other in other browsers in another website.So if you're using Firefox or Safari and you have this, you have a plug in for Google Search.Then when I use when somebody searches there and I see the results on that page, that could also beconsidered part of the Google search partner network.The list, there is no official list of Google search partners.That's sort of annoying, right?There's no official list.Google is very opaque with which websites are included.They give a few examples and it does change regularly.What we've typically seen is that click through rate on partner sites will not affect the quality scoreof your keywords.That's a great question a lot of people have had and we haven't gotten into quality score yet, buta lot of you know what quality score is and and click the rate is one of the factors inside qualityscore.It actually accounts for about 65% of quality score.It's a really important factor.But if you have a less than average or a poorer, a worse click through rate on a certain keyword froma partner site.It will not affect quality score on your keywords, your actual keyword level quality score.We've also found that the rate does tend to be significantly lower on search partner sites we've seenas well.Cost per click to be lower, but we've also seen conversion rates to be lower.So all indicators seem to indicate that the quality of traffic coming from Google search partners isn'tas good.Another interesting point to note about the search partner network.If you choose to run your ads on the search partner network is that you'll never know what sites yourads appeared on.You are able to know how much traffic you've gotten from search partner sites.I'll show you how to segment that out inside your AdWords report so you could see the percentage oftraffic, the number of clicks, impressions, click the rate, volume of conversions, cost per conversionrates, all the different columns that you have available.I'll show you how to see that.But you won't know what sites they came up they they were from.That's different than the display network.When you do run display network campaigns, you are able to see a list of the websites that showed yourad where you got traffic from.So you're able to optimize and say, oh, when I when my my ads are performing well on this placement,but not so well on this placement when it comes to the Google search partner network you it's it's allor nothing.I'm either running ads in the Google search partner network or I'm not.So what do you need to know about the search partner network?Some strategies and some suggestions for branded search terms.So when I say branded search terms, I mean when people are searching for the name of your brand, thename of your company, then the search partner network sometimes converts better, but also has higheraverage CPCs.Now, why do you think that might be?Take a second to think about it.So one reason I think is a logical reason is that there's less competition on Google search.A lot of your competitors will be running their own ads against your brand on Google search campaigns,and they might not be opting into the Google search partner network.So there'll be less competition.So if somebody searches for your brand right away, if you're running on the search partner network,it's going to get more a larger share of those clicks.Whereas on Google, it's very possible that some of your competitors, especially in your in you'rein a bigger space, in a more aggressive competitive landscape that some of your competitors are actuallyrunning ads on your branded search terms, which is kind of stinks, but it's part of the game.And we can talk about branded campaigns.But long story short, I would recommend using the search partner network, opting into the search partnernetwork for branded campaigns.There's no right or wrong answer as to whether or not you should advertise on the search partner network.But here's a basic thing to think about.If you have a limited budget and you're just starting out, I highly recommend excluding the searchpartner network.You can always add it later.I always say whatever money that you could spend on Google search on Google search itself without thesearch partner network you should be spending on Google Search.That's something which is just a really, really good overall best practice.Google Search will typically perform the best out of any other campaign type in AdWords, in Googleads except for Google Shopping.And that's a whole separate category.But you should really consider excluding search partners.And if this is your first campaign or your first group of campaign, or if you're if you think you havemore money that you can spend on Google Search, then you should continue to exclude Google search partnersexcept for branded traffic and only work on the Google Search Network.I highly recommend that strategy.Definitely add the search partner network before expanding budget into display campaigns.Right.We spoke about how display is like this, interruptive marketing.It's a totally different context.You're showing ads and the size of block pages.You have no ability to capitalize on commercial intent.The Google search partner network still capitalizes on commercial intent.We're still able to show our ad at the to the person who wants what we are selling when they're specificallyrequesting information about the product and services that we sell.So you still have that that aspect.But the traffic, for whatever reasons, the traffic from Google is better.It's higher quality.Typically, you'll see through Google Analytics that that that traffic will stay on your site for longer.You'll have a lower bounce rate, have a higher conversion rate.So as much money as you could spend on Google search, you should.And if you absolutely hit the roof and most of you haven't, it's like you guys, it's crazy how muchvolume there is on Google, even for some more obscure search terms.Then you could think about expanding and going back into the campaign and adding search partner networks.You could always add that later after you've created the campaign.So that's a little bit about the search partner network, what you need to know.Let's jump back into our Google Ads account setup and I'm going to deselect include Google search partners.And of course, you see this little notification from Google right here.Most advertisers include their ads on Google search partner sites.Great.Thank you.Guess why?Guess why they want you to do that.Take a wild guess.They want you to spend more money.Google gets paid a commission every single time you click an ad on any of their search partner sites.So they're very, very, very interested in having you spend money on the Google search partner network.Kind of down here.You have this nice little, little notification.Don't miss the opportunity to reach more people across 3 million sites and apps.Sounds so enticing.That's another way for Larry and Sergey to get your money.Don't give it to them.Don't give it to them.Spend your money wisely.Spend your money like an expert.Spend your money like a pro.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about locations.Probably break this down into a couple of lectures.It's going to be a lot to talk about, lots of different ways to set up location targeting and thingsto think about.And once we get into the advanced options, there'll be more things to think about in terms of targetingand excluding.And I will see you guys very soon in the very next lecture when we begin talking about location settings.Cheers for now.
