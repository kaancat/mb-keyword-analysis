# 20.8 Keyword Match Types- Phrase Match

How do you glass fans and welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about phrase match phrase match uses quotation marks to make sureyour ad only appears for a search as containing your exact keyword and close variance with additionalwords or phrases potentially before or after your keyword still can generate a lot of bad clicks foryour relevant queries, but you're getting much closer to getting real control over which search termsare triggering keywords.The defining characteristic of phrase match is query must include your entire keyword in the correctorder.Unlike broad match modified and it's unlike exact match in that phrase, match could still have appendedpretended words or phrases to the in search query, and it still trigger that phrase match keyword.So let's go through some examples of phrase match keywords and what ads will show for and what ads willnot show for.Leather desk chair.Right.Closed in quotation marks over here.Buy leather desk chairs online.That's an example of what an ad might show for.Even though by.And online.We're not included in my phrase, but.Leather desk chair are included in that search in the right order as I had them in my keyword.Ads will not show for buy leather chairs online because my phrase was leather desk chair and that phraseis not inside that search query.Office accessories enclose in quotation marks.Images of office accessories.That's a plus, because again, my phrase office accessories appears in the search query with all thewords in the same order.Accessories office will not show because while it has all the words, it will.It's in the wrong order.Right.And that's sort of the rule of phrase match extra padded chairs.Enclosed in quotation marks is the phrase match keyword extra pedicures for free.That's good to go, because even though for free is probably not a search term that I want to bid onsince somebody clearly looking not to pay me if I'm popping, but yet it's still going by the rulesof phrase match because extra predators is in that search term in the correct order, with all the wordspadded chairs with extra padding will not show because while it has all the right terms, it has extrapadded and chairs.It's again, not in the appropriate order.Let's talk about some pros and cons of phrase match.You're beginning to get more control over your search terms, less unpredictability than broad and broadmatch modified.You'll when you open up your search term report for a phrase match keyword, you're going to have alot less surprises, right?Because you'll have a lot less irrelevant clicks.Google doesn't have as much control.They don't have the full range of they're not pulling from as much of that pool of related potentialtraffic to that keyword because you're now constricting that net to whatever sample of that entire potentialpool.Has your entire keyword in that exact order phrase match still allows you to discover new ideas becauseyou could find bad keywords, like somebody searching for buy leather office chairs for free.You could also find some good keywords like sale on leather office chairs or something like that.And you might want to put an ad group together for people searching for something on sale.If you're running a sale.So you'll find good ideas for new keywords, but not as much or not as many as match, modified andbroad match.You'll see an improved click the rate overall match modified.It's usually a cheaper cost per click, then exact match.And I say usually because it's not always true.Sometimes your phrase match keywords will be more competitive, competitively saturated than your exactmatch keywords.That's totally a possibility.There's no rule, but over the aggregate you'll typically see your phrase match keywords costing lesson a CPC basis on an average CPC basis than your exact match keywords.Some of the downsides or some of the things to look out for with phrase match, you still need to beaware for negative keywords limits search volume for search terms in different order than your keywords.Oftentimes the order doesn't matter, and sometimes people are too aggressive with phrase match, whichis why it's not my favorite keyword match type.I use phrase match the least.I'm usually using broad bar match modified in exact match phrase match.I find that it's not always the case or it's not usually the case that an exact phrase really matters.Say you're searching the search term is Google Ads Management Company.Is that markedly different than companies that manage Google AdWords campaigns so match modify wouldtypically would be fine it's hard to find examples of that exact phrases is it matters you could havepeople in the travel business if I'm searching for airline tickets between JFK and and Los Angeles,then the order matters.So there certainly are cases for the to be made for phrase match.Limits the quality of of data and ideas you'll get with phrase match.You're not getting as many ideas, especially when you start off.So if you're building a new campaign from scratch.Limit your use of phrase map.Your campaign should probably be something like 80% broad bar match modified and 20% freeze and exact.That's what sort of what my guideline for that would be.And lastly, phrase match typically will be more expensive than broad and broad match modified.But again, that's not a downside.More expensive cost per click are usually a good thing.It's just something to watch out for.It's something to be.Don't get caught by surprise when you see your phrase match keywords be more expensive, but not onlydon't get caught by surprise.Also, you have to know that going into it, if you want to be high on the page, if you want to winpremier ad spots, even if your Google quality scores and your QB level quality scores are really goodat seven out of ten and above, you're still going to need to bid higher, bid more aggressively onphrase match and even more aggressively on an exact match.But certainly if you're running phrase match keywords, your bids should be higher.As a general rule of thumb, starting out that broad match modified and broad match keywords, thenyou'll get the right amount of impressions.You'll get the most impression share for those keywords if you're bidding a little bit higher.So realize that as well.And again, it's not arbitrary.The reason why better keywords cost more is because your competitors figured out that those keywordsare more profitable.So if you want to play in that game and you want to also get clicks to your website that are going tobe more profitable, you need to pay for those clicks in the same range as your competitors are playing.So.Those are the things to know about phrase match and now you have an understanding about that.Lastly, for the positive math types, in the next lecture we'll cover exact match keywords when touse them.Some of the things to watch out for how they work and some of the things to know about exact match keywords.After Google has made some some updates.So I'll see you guys in a couple of seconds in the very next lecture.
