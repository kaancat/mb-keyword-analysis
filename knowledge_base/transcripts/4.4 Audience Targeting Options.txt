# 4.4 Audience Targeting Options

Welcome back.Let's discuss audience targeting options.There are five core audience buckets.Affinity audiences, custom affinity audiences, in-market audiences, custom intent audiences, andlife events.I know this is complicated.This is a lot of words, but it's worth understanding what all of these things are and what is an affinityaudience.Affinity audiences are users who Google groups based on their interests, their hobbies, their longterm passions ideal for brand awareness campaigns.Now this.I know this sounds broad, and some examples are sports enthusiasts, tech enthusiasts, and travelbuffs.So look, a travel buff is somebody who likes to travel.Google knows that this person travels more than most people travel.Google is not saying that this person is in the market for a car, or that this person is in the marketfor a plane ticket to Boston, or that this person who is a sports enthusiast is in the market for gamesto them is for tickets to the Mets game tonight.Google is not saying that.Google is just saying that these are people who are generally inclined towards these activities.This is very useful if you're trying to drive awareness for people who might, down the road, purchasea product from you.Affinity audiences could be a good targeting tool or an observation tool to use.If you sell something that is that you know that a sports enthusiast would never buy.You might use an affinity audience as an exclusion list.I would recommend rarely and perhaps never using an affinity audience as an exclusion list because it'sjust too broad.I have a hard time imagining that there's any given product or service that would never be purchasedby somebody who's in any of these affinity audience categories, but if you have an idea and you thinkI'm incorrect, please drop a note in the discussion forum.Custom Affinity Audiences interesting tool that Google released a little while back, which allows advertisersto create custom audiences based on specific interests, keywords, URLs, and apps.So Google is allowing me as the advertiser or you as the advertiser to create your own affinity category.For example, people interested in sustainable fashion or gourmet cooking, or frequent visitors ofa particular competitor's website.So if I say, hey, people who go to this site are likely people interested in what I have to offer,then I could tell Google to to build an audience of people who visit specific websites.That doesn't necessarily mean that these are people who have had to visit that website.By the way, that's a clear differentiation.Google is not giving you an audience of people who specifically visited another site.Google is going to say, okay, visitors of that site, what do those people have in common?And then they're going to give you a cohort, a population of people who they think fits that behavioralparadigm of the visitors of that site.So that's a clear that's a that's a that's an important, um, point of differentiation with customaffinity audiences.Next we have in-market audience.So in-market as it sounds is Google's way of saying, this is how you could reach people who we thinkare in the buying stage, and this is going to be much more relevant for most of you, um, more relevantthan affinity audiences or even custom Affinity audiences.Affinity is a general inclination or passion for a topic or category an in-market audience.Is Google saying we think that this person is actually trying to buy something?So in-market audiences target users actively researching or planning to purchase products or services.And of course, in-market audiences are most suitable for performance driven campaigns, campaigns whereyou're looking and tracking results on a linear basis.People looking to buy a car, planning a vacation or shopping for home insurance.So, for example, just as a personal example, I'm doing renovation on a home now.My entire Instagram feed, literally, I would say 98% of what I see on Instagram are home related adsand posts.Whether it's tile or light fixtures or bathroom vanities or shower fixtures, or glass cutters, orkitchen countertop manufacturers or quarries or, um, exterior door manufacturers, because meta knowsthat I'm in the market for home furnishings.They've seen me purchase things on Wayfair, they've seen me drive out to marble showrooms.They've seen me researching Kohler and Moen and California faucets and roll and these different brands.So Google and Meta have identified me as being in the market for home furnishings.So if you selected as a if you selected to target an in-market audience of of people in home Improvement,I might be on that list.Custom intent audiences.So similar to custom affinity audiences, it allows advertisers to define and reach specific audiencesbased on their recent purchase intent or interest in particular keywords.So for example, custom intent audiences allows me to say people who have searched for the best smartphones2024 or affordable health insurance.I want you to show my ads to those people and those people only.So custom intent audiences is one of the best ways for niche products or companies on a more of a shoestringbudget, and combining custom intent audiences with broad match keyword targeting can be a very, verypowerful way of really controlling budget and making sure that you're only showing ads to the best possibleaudiences.Then you have life events, so target users undergoing major life changes such as moving, getting married,or graduating.And that's very useful for timely and relevant advertising.So we have a client who is in the wedding planning space.We actually have a few clients in the wedding planning space, from invitations to bans to bridal dressesto engagement rings to wedding venues.We actually have clients in all of those different categories.So using the life events Targeting parameter inside Google is a very effective way.Again, to narrow the scope of our broad match searches, search campaigns, to narrow the scope orto contain the scope of display advertising, to display, to contain the scope of, of the impressionsand clicks, and to sort of direct that budget to audiences who at least Google identifies as approachingor going through one of these life events that are highly relevant and highly specific to our customersas products or to our products.The next five important audience targeting options to understand are detailed demographics, customermatch, similar audiences, remarketing, and lookalike audiences.Again, there are a lot of different audience definitions and audience targeting categories that arerelevant, and it's worthwhile to understand all of them.Detailed demographics targets users based on characteristics like parental status, marital status,educational level, and home ownership status.So for example, parents of toddlers, college graduates, homeowners If you're selling baby formulaor pacifiers.So you want to be targeting parents of toddlers.Detailed demographics is a great way to to specify in performance campaigns, uh, a specific characteristic,a demographic of a person.If you know that that demographic is highly relevant and other demographics are not.Be careful with making judgments, even in the case of, um, of baby formula or things for babies.What about people who are not parents of toddlers searching for gifts?By going to specific with detailed demographics, you run the risk of avoiding, or at least diminishingthe amount of impressions that you could receive by neglecting a certain audience that doesn't fit thatdetailed demographic, but is still interested in purchasing your product.So if you remember when we talked about targeting observation and exclusions, If you're unsure.Similar to a subjective keyword, a subjective a subjective negative keyword.If you're unsure whether or not you should add a detailed demographic to constrain the scope of yourcampaigns, then just add that detailed demographic as as an observation mode.Targeting.That way you'll have a week, two weeks, three weeks to analyze the results.And maybe you'll see that while parents of toddlers really doesn't have a much larger, um, conversionrate or a much higher AOV than people who are not in that detailed demographic, and you'll get thatinformation and you can make good decisions based on that information.Next we have customer match.Customer match uses your customer data so your customer email addresses that you own to target ads tothose users across Google properties.So if I want to, um, specifically target my customers with upsell opportunities, cross-sell opportunities,loyalty opportunities, I could upload an entire list of customer emails to Google.Google will anonymize that list, and Google will then specifically target those users across Googleproperties.And an example there is retargeting previous customers or upselling to existing clients or to specificlists.That we've collected similar audiences is sort of the opposite.Or the or the cousin of customer match similar audiences tells Google to target new users.So not my existing customers, new people who have never been to my site, or people who are not myactual customers, who have not converted on our site, but they have similar characteristics to ourexisting customers, expanding our reach.So we would still upload a list.We would still give Google that data, who our customers are, who our most engaged users are, andGoogle will say, okay, what do I know about these people?Let me go out and find other people that are similar to all the customers that you already have.So users who share traits with your customers list, with your customer list or website visitors.And this is one of the most popular ways of using audience targeting in conjunction with search advertising,where you could then bid more aggressively on matched audiences across Google properties.It's a really, really successful way of doing this remarketing.Most of you are familiar with the term remarketing, where we're specifically targeting ads to peoplewho have previously been on our site.So it's different than customer match.Customer match are actual people who have converted.We have their email address.Remarketing is we just have dropped a cookie on their browser.We just know that this user has been to our site, and we want to target users who have previously interactedwith our app, our landing pages, or any of our other content.For example, users who abandoned their shopping cart or visited specific product pages or downloadedour app.Yet we don't necessarily have their information.We don't necessarily have their email.We could use remarketing via the Google Ads tag and the Google Analytics tag to continue to show themmessages, or to specifically target them with messages as they browse the web.If they're on YouTube, if they're on Google Search again, Gmail, etc..Lookalike audiences targets new users with similar characteristics to your best performing customers.So Whereas similar audiences are an expansion based on any of the actual customer data that we giveGoogle a lookalike audiences, a lookalike audience looks at the entire population of the of the locationswe're targeting.So example, if we're in the United States, it's going to look at 400 million people.And if I create a 1% lookalike audience, I'm going to get 1% of that 400 million, 4 million peopleon my total population list.So that's how Lookalike Audiences works.And it it takes the most representative 1% or 2% or 5% of the United States and matches them to ourbest performing customers.And this is something which is very powerful and likely you'll likely to see results when you're runningdemand gen campaigns within Google.When you're trying to generate more demand, more people interested in your product.So lookalike audience matching is a really powerful way to do that.So, for example, for lookalike audiences, users similar to those who have converted or performedvaluable actions on your site, you would give Google a list or you would be tracking with conversionactions.Um, micro conversions, people who viewed key pages, people, users with, let's say, an above averageengagement rate, users who submitted a form, users who downloaded a piece of content, um, userswho converted whatever it may be.And you could say, you could say to Google, look at all of these conversions and all of the peoplewho have, in aggregate, completed or took these conversion actions and now go find a lookalike audience,a percentage of the total population that I'm targeting, and show my ads specifically to those peopleand lookalike audiences are a very effective way of doing this, of of narrowing the scope and generatinghigher profitability from your campaigns.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about strategies, winning strategies, using audience targetingtactics.Looking forward to seeing you there.
