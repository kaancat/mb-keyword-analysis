# 20.15 Adding Negative Keywords at The Ad Group Level

How to Google Ads fans.And welcome back.We spent about 20 minutes just now talking about traffic sculpting and double sculpting and all thatfun stuff.And now let's just talk about adding negative keywords to the aggregate level, practically inside Googleads.Remember, and I'm jumping ahead just a drop.You don't you can have negative keyword lists apply to the ad level.You can only have negative keyword lists apply to the campaign level.So aggregate level level negatives have to be added at the ad level.So let's go back jump into our burner account that we're building for pop in and pop in is getting somefree traffic off us.But that's okay.Here we have our campaign office chairs and I just took the liberty of really building out a quick adgroup for rolling desk chairs.And the idea conceptually, this is what this is what's really important to understand.The aggregate for generic general office chairs is going to sort of be what I call our catch all.It's going to be anything that doesn't fit into any of the specific ad groups that we're going to buildout for specific types of office chairs.So we're going to have rolling office chairs.We're going to have officers with high backs.We're going to have lumbar support office chairs, ergonomic.Those will all be separate groups because those are all separate themes.And as we further on in this section, we're going to build out this campaign with thematically relatedgroups of keywords.But just for now, just for the sake of understanding, we have these two groups.So say in our general office chairs ad group, we start getting searches for desk chairs with wheelsrolling, office chairs, things like that.But the landing page for these ad groups, the landing page for these keywords in this ad group is goingto Poppins area, the area of pop and site.That is generic.It's just all of our office chairs.And let's just jump over to pop in real quick again.We're going to go over to the wheeled section if we go to furniture.Get rid of these popovers.We're going to go to office chairs and tools and we're going to go to features and we're going to findwheels.And this is the section and this is the page that I want people from.Anybody searching for an office with office chair with wheels to land on.And that's why I have that other ad group set up.Well, that's one of the reasons.The other reason is maybe I have a different bidding strategy.I'm bidding more aggressively.I want to allocate more, more resources or try to get Google to give it more impressions, whateverit may be.So I'm going to go back to Google and say, like I said, for example, if I was getting all these searchterms for four wheeled office chairs inside this in the side of this ad group, and even if I wasn't,this would be a good preemptive measure.It's really good to get in the habit of adding these.Add group level sculpting keywords even before the data comes in.It just keeps things really nicely organized.So I need to navigate into the ad group level.It's the easiest way to do it.So I to go to my general office chairs and conceptually what I want to do is I want to add wheels rollingas negative broad matches for just this ad group, which will then force Google to show ads for my rollingdesk chairs, ad group any single time somebody uses the word wheel.So I'm going to go into again this general office chair as ad group.I'm going to navigate to my keywords tab in the secondary vertical menu and then in the secondary horizontalmenu, I'm going to go to negative keywords and I'm going to add a new negative keyword.Over here we see a whole list of all my keywords that are applied at the campaign level, and we don'thave any at the aggregate level yet.I'm going to hit new keyword.I'm going to select by default, negative keywords or create a new list, and I'm going to add it toan ad group.It's already preselected for me since I came here through the ad group.But let's say I was at the campaign level to go back to the campaign.I click on the campaign name in the primary vertical navigation, and now I'm in keywords.And then I go to negative keywords and I go to add a negative keyword.From here I then could add to campaign, but instead of adding to campaign, switch that selection toadd to ad group.And then I can select the ad group that I want to do it, which is general office chairs.So you can do it that way as well.And now I'm going to simply go ahead and add my negative keywords, wheels, wheel rolling roll andany other keywords that might apply that I might want to sculpt out out of this.Or I want to prevent any search firms from showing up in this specific ad group.I want to make sure that they're broad match again, click save.And now we'll be able to see in this report that they have been added to this campaign office chairs.And then you see the little Chevron general office chairs.Is that accurate that they've been added to the level that they're added on, which is the ad groupand the match type of that negative keyword, which is broad.Now, let's take this one step further.Let's say in my rolling desk chairs, ad group, which has a few keywords here, doesn't have any databecause it's brand new.But let's just say, for example, I open up the search firm's report in a few days and I see that I'mgetting a bunch of searches for desk chairs.Just desk chairs, but just desk chairs is not a search term that I want in this ad group.If somebody is searching for dust, just desk chairs, without wheels or without rolling, I want themshowing up in the generic general office chairs.I've messed up generic and general.I want them showing up in the general office chairs ad group.Why?Because in the general office chairs, ad group, two things are happening.As you know, I have a lower bid and that might come in the form of a lower manual bid or a lower bidbased on a target CPA bidding strategy or something else.And I'm sending the traffic to just the generic section of the site that has all my office chairs soa person could self-select and self-identify with with which specific chair that they want.In a search term like office chairs, a person is not expressing through his search room the commercialintent of what type of chair he wants to buy.So I'm not going to go in and and, you know, anticipate or suspect that he wants or guess that hewants or she wants a rolling chair or a high back chair or an executive chair or a leather chair ora fabric chair or an orange chair.I just want to send them to all my chairs, because that's what you've expressed that you're lookingfor.So desk chairs.So anyway, so what do I do?Well, I could go ahead and do a sculpting on this group as well.So I'm going to go to rolling desk chairs.I'm going to go into my negative keywords.I'm going to add a keyword and go to apply it to my rolling desk, keep it self, keep it preselectedto my ad group, rolling desk chairs.And now I'm going to enter a negative keyword.I'm going to enter desk chairs.Now, if you were if you were about to yell at me and say, Isaac, you're making a big mistake.If you add it as a broad match, then even when somebody searches for desk chairs with wheels, it'snot going to show up in this in this ad group anymore.And that's what you want the keyword to show up in this aggregate.And I would say you're right.You were listening.You were listening in the last section.It would be incorrect in this case to add it as a broad match keyword, we must add desk chairs as anexact match, negative keyword.So I'm going to take my brackets on to give it a bracket in the beginning.And now I've ensured that only when somebody searches for desk chairs without anything else, it preventsit from showing up in this ad group.It will force it to go to the General Officers Ad Group in this context when we only have these twodifferent ad groups.But if somebody searches for a desk chairs with wheels, it's going to show up in this ad group becausewheels is a negative keyword in this top ad group, general office chairs.So I'm going to add desk chairs as a negative keyword here, exact match, click save.And now I've done some really cool high level sculpting.Now one more thing to remember as I build out this.As I build out this campaign, I'm going to have general office chairs, rolling desk chairs, orangedesk chairs, lumbar support gestures, ergonomic, expensive leather fabric.I'm going to have all these different ad groups.I'm going to go and need to add that exact match desk chairs to every single one of those.Remember that if let's say I have ten different ADD groups and general office chairs is one out of thoseten.So I'm going to want to have negative exact match desk chairs in nine of those ad groups, which thenforces Google when anybody whenever somebody just searches that generic desk chairs, exact match keyword.That exact search term just disappears.They don't include a color.They don't include a fabric.They don't include a size.They don't include a price.They don't include a feature.It's going to force Google to send that to my general office chairs.It'll go to the right page, it'll be on the right ad and and it will be bid on with the right amountof money my right mac CPC bid that I want.So that's the power of sculpting and that's how to go ahead and start adding your negative keywordsat the ad group level.That's how to do it either at either starting from the top level of the campaign or from first drillingdown into the ad group.And it's also how to start thinking about whether or not your ad group level negative should be broadmatch phrase, match or exact match.I hope that this has been incredibly helpful and as a quick exercise, I would take a pen and paperlike I've done in the past, or take a whiteboard or just do it on a computer and think of three orfour different ways that you could sculpt traffic between ad groups.Think of like, Oh, maybe that this search term is going to trigger a keyword in this ad group andit's going to be showing an ad from this ad group.It's going to go to the wrong page on the site and it's going to have the wrong bid.How can I sculpt that search term to the right ad group in my account?Think of 2 to 4 examples in your account how you could do that.And if you're feeling extra ambitious, write it down and go do it.Get sculpting, get sculpting, get sculpting, get sculpting.So that's how to do it manually.Inside AdWords, inside Google ads.In the very next lecture, I'm going to show you how to use a really awesome tool called Optimizer,which I've mentioned in the past, which actually has a built in traffic sculpting tool to use.And I will see you guys in a couple of seconds in the very next lecture.
