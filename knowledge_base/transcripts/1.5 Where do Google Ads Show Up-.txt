# 1.5 Where do Google Ads Show Up-

How did Google ads fans and welcome back thankfully have a background in art.As you could tell from my beautiful primitive drawings of a Google search results page.But I want to quickly run through where Google ads show up like we're talking about all the stuff aboutluxury advertising networks, talking about click through rate.We're talking about AdWords scripts, Google ad scripts.We're talking about all this incredible, all these incredibly powerful techniques and tools.But let's just take a step back, simplify things a little bit.What are we even talking about here?What ads?What's how do we conceptualize these ads?Where are these ads showing up?So on a Google search page, if you go to Google.com, you do you do a Google search.You search for anything you might want to be searching for.In my example, somebody searches for women's boots.Now, remember, women's boots is not the keyword.Do you guys know what women's boots is?It is the.Search term.Okay.So women's boots in this example is the search term.It's what the user is, what the user actually typed into the Google search box, women's boots.Now, it used to be a lot of you will probably remember this, that on the side of the page, therewere also a lot of results in ads.Well, Google a while back, remove those and there's only ads above and below the organic results.So the but always the first 2 to 4, maximum four at the top of the page, the top of organic resultswill be sponsored results.And it's going to be it's going to look different on mobile and on.I'll show you what it looks like.I'm mobile and I'll show you what it looks like on a desktop.But the.One more thing.Not every single search will have ads.Every search will have a result.Almost every search will have some sort of Google result unless you're searching for something totallyoutlandish and wacky.But not every single search will have advertising results.Not every search will have sponsored results at the top, but in most cases, the first two, threeand four results at the top of the page right over here.These in the blue.These are ads and they'll have an indication usually right along here.Google switches this up all the time, signifying and conveying that it's an ad below the ads over here.Are the organic results?These are the organic results.The right side of the page on a desktop computer.Are typically reserved for either nothing or sometimes you'll have an information box if you searchfor a specific business or you search for a product or service that's similar enough.You'll see an information box about that specific business or what's very common is you'll see shoppingads here, Google shopping ads.It's a different type of ad.It still runs on the search network.They are product.They used to be called product listing ads.Now they're just called Google shopping ads, where they see an image of the product, a price of theproduct, and a link to click and go check that product out.Those are Google shopping ads.Now, sometimes Google shopping ads for a very product driven, commercial intent driven query.Google shopping ads might might show as a carousel, as a scrolling carousel, even on a desktop computer.And this happens very often on mobile devices.Google shopping ads are now showing up more and more frequently at the top of mobile devices.If you're running a product feed and they'll typically show up above a couple, two or three text ads.These are text ads on the search network.These would be shopping ads in the search network.But this is the basic structure of a Google search result.And let's just go see and.So this is the basic structure of a Google search result and all and everything that we're doing, everythingin this course.Whenever we use Google ads and this this complicated, massive software and this interface, it's reallyessentially to get ads here.At the right time in front of the right person and for the right for the right amount of money.So let's go jump over to the screen and take a look at what this looks like.So I'm going to do a search for women's boots.Sure enough, the page reflects what we anticipated to reflect.So over here the top one, two, three, four are text ads.These are ads that that these companies, Cole Haan, Free People.com, Farfetch.com and Zappos.comare all paying or all telling Google.There's a maximum CPC that we're willing to pay.There's a maximum cost per click that we're willing to pay.You.Google, if somebody clicks our ads and based on their quality score, gets them into this auction,these are text ads on the right hand side are sponsored shopping ads.Right.You see the picture, there's a link, there's a price, there's a rating.These are shopping ads.And again, since Women's Boots is a very commercial query, since women's boots is very commerciallydriven, Google reads that as it's likely somebody looking for a product, not necessarily for a serviceor information, they're more likely to show the shopping ads on the right side of the page.So in this case, we have four eyes at the top.And then this is the this this already by DSW e-comm is an organic result.So like it's really not that easy to tell what's an ad and what's an organic result.It's like if you really only have this little green ad button and that's very easily missed unless you'rereally looking out for it or you're super familiar or tech savvy, like you're likely a person who'ssort of your casual Google user is likely to miss it.So you could sort of see why 45% of people don't really know the difference between a Google organicresult in a paid result.And if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you'll see three more ads at the bottom of the pagefor just fab the out net and Charleston shoe COCOM.And again, you're typically not going to have more than eight ads on a page text ads.I'm talking about four of the top three at the bottom, three or four at the bottom, never more thanfive at the top.And you'll have a bunch of shopping ads potentially on the right hand side.But if you did a search for, let's say, PPC agency right, then you're going to see this informationbox.Now, since I'm in New York and I'm close to Adventure Media Group, you'll see our PPC agency overhere.This is an information box that shows our map, some pictures, 83 4.9 client reviews.Thank you very much.Other people searched for this.This is what's called an information box.But then on top, you have a couple of ads.You have one, you have PPC, Fool.com, Northstar ads, elite awesome Internet ad pros.Right.And you'll have some more ads at the bottom.Those are the text.So that's the anatomy of a search page.That's the types of advertising that we're attempting to run when we run Google ads campaigns.Now, let's talk quickly about the display network.And let me show you real quick what the display network ads look like and where they show up.Bear with me 1/2 and we're back.So excuse my sloppy drawing here, but just to give you a sense of display network advertising.Display network advertising basically refers to any advertising that's done not on Google.com and notnot on other Google owned properties like maps dot com and Google business pages, etc..All other websites that have ads and most websites are monetized by being able to show ads, you'reable to reach through the Google Display Network.There's all different sorts of ways you could target your ads so you can target based on previous browsingactivity.You could be running remarketing campaigns, you could target, you could target a specific websiteor a specific section of a website if you want.But here's an example of a web page.Let's say let's say this is a page in the Wall Street Journal.So you have anything shaded in blue is an ad in my example.But these ads could show up anywhere.They could be anywhere on the page.Some pages have fewer ads, some some pages have more ads in different locations, etc..But you have your organic content similar to your Google search results page and you have your actualarticle over here.You have part of the article.You have links to author bios.Let's say on a typical blog, you have other articles a person could click to on a blog, but then youhave all these different parts of the ad of the page that are actually ads.Not not every one of these ads that you're going to see are going to be coming from Google ads.They could be coming from other ad exchanges.They could be coming from other demand side platforms.If you're interested to learn about how all this technology works, how demand side platforms, DSPssupply side platforms, how they interact through ad exchanges, how cookies and pixels, callbacks,and all these interesting technology works, you could check out my other course on remarketing anddisplay network technology, but be that as it may, your ads are going to show up on these other websitepages.It's a really, really good way of getting a lot of additional cheap traffic now because you're notable to target when you're running display campaigns, you don't know the user's intent.If I'm if I'm reading The Wall Street Journal, I may or may not be interested in what you have to advertiseto me or what you have to sell.That's why it's not as competitive and it's not as it's not as effective as search advertising.But that doesn't necessarily mean that your return on ad spend will be less nine times out of ten.I recommend my students and I and I recommend my clients.Whatever budget you could spend on search should be spent on search.It's just going to convert better.It's going to be better advertising dollars spent.But the display network is an interesting place if you want to expand your reach and run brand awarenesscampaigns.And again, brand awareness campaigns is only for the sake of eventually earning profit.But just brand awareness usually means I expect profit further down the line.Then the display network might be an excellent place to do that.Let's jump over to the computer really quickly.Maybe we'll visit the Wall Street Journal and maybe we could point out some ads that are being servedto me from the Google Display Network.So let's take a look here at the computer.I'm going to go to the Wall Street Journal.I'm going to go to the Wall Street Journal dot com and you see The New York Times actually showing anad there.Let's see what we got here.Let's go click on a link.We're set to file for bankruptcy.And we should see some ads.Great.Here's a remarketing ad from a client of ours, actually.SOFA mania.That's a client.This is this is actually a marketing ad that we ourselves are serving.So and I've visited the sites serving that ad to me.But this is an actual ad.And if I click this button over here ad choices, it would show me that it's coming from Criteo, whichis a demand side platform.Like I said, not every single ad is going to come from Google ads, but say, I want to go into Incognitoand I would go to the New York Times.And I would see.So let's go to The New York Times and let's have a go to The New York Times home page over here andwe see what shows up.Here's an ad from Citibank.This is a big custom leaderboard ad.And if I scroll down and I go into any specific article page.I'll probably see an ad at the top.I'll see you at the bottom.Well, this isn't actually an ad for a New York Times, but if I scroll through the page, I'll see.Continue.I'll continue to see more and more ads.Now, some of these ads can be coming from from Google ads, from other clients.Some of them could be coming from other demand side platforms as well.Over here, here's a ad for a company called Allbirds, which looks like it's selling shoes.If I click on Ad Choices, I could see that this is actually a Google ad.Perfect.So this is a company, Allbirds, that's running a Google ads campaign that's targeting the displaynetwork.Now, they might have been targeting me because they think that I'm in the market for shoes becauseI actually have been looking at other shoes and sneakers website recently.I am in incognito mode, but Google knows a lot about us.They could just be targeting New York Times readers, although that's unlikely.But there's whatever the targeting is, and we'll talk about display network advertising, how to setup campaigns, how to think about targeting, how all the settings, configurations, bidding and soon and so forth.Designing an ad.This is a decent looking, designed, decent looking ad, but that's the concept, right?I'm on a web page, I'm reading an article.I'm not on Google.com, I'm showing an ad.This was an ad shown to me through a Google ads account run by Allbirds or Allbirds is agency, andthey're serving that ad to me here on this page off of Google.com.This is display advertising.So now that you have an understanding of where ads show up, whether they be on search text ads, shoppingads, top bottom, where they show up in display network and you understand the power and the breadth.There's the enormity of of of just Google advertising.And, you know, what was that number of of money Google makes?I think it was $77,851,500,000 in ad revenue every single year.And it's just growing.You should be sufficiently excited and prepared to now hone your skills, develop your skill set soyou could run these campaigns profitably, which, again, I will continue to say this.I will never bore of saying this.It's all about being profitable.Everything we're doing here is all the side trappings, the core purpose.The only measure of success is profit.And just by being here and getting started with me today, we are all well on our way to that extraordinaryand worthwhile goal of running profitable advertising campaigns.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture and the next section where we willbe creating our first Google Ads account together.Step by step.Cheers for now.
