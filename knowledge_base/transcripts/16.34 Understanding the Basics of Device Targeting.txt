# 16.34 Understanding the Basics of Device Targeting

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.While device settings is not one of the core settings you set up while you're creating your first campaign,it's still worthwhile talking about now because it's sort of along the same lines of all the differentoptimization techniques we've been talking about, like location targeting and hour of day targetingand rotation settings.It's worthwhile.I want to take a pause and spend a few minutes talking about different devices and sort of how I perceivethem.The big question is mobile.Mobile is increasing.Mobile already has more searches daily, more clicks on ads than desktop.That is a fact.And it's been released by Google and that's something which really needs to be taken seriously.When I started in this business, mobile was was very, very small percentage of traffic, really.It was like, do you even like we would we would launch campaigns, not advertising on mobile and thenmaybe we would add mobile in and now it's totally changed.Desktop campaigns will still work better in a lot of businesses.We'll see conversion rates be higher on desktop, and that's just because sites are typically not aswell optimized.And there's a lot that goes into that.We'll talk about that.But each one of these device categories desktop, tablet and phone need to all be taken seriously andneed to all be strongly considered.So one way that I've seen and we've done in the past, structuring campaigns and structuring ad groupsis by structuring them by device.We actually took over an account a few months ago spending a ton of money.They had their campaigns and aggregates broken out by device types.So they had ad groups for this product category for tablet only tablet this product category only phones,this product category only desktop.And you could do that in Google ads.You could specify a -100% bit adjustment for any of these device categories.And that's something which is really interesting because you need to be able to look at your data andfigure that out.But first, let's go and answer some questions.Should you advertise on mobile?So the number number one question you need to answer is, is your site mobile optimized?If you don't have a mobile site, then then you really shouldn't be advertising on mobile.You're going to be penalized by Google.You're going to have a very, very high cost per click.So if you don't have a mobile site or a mobile landing page, then forget mobile, just forget it,just send it to desktop.And we have a bunch of clients that actually sell a custom clothing and things like that, and theydon't have a mobile interface.They do a huge amount of business, but they do it through their desktop and that's fine.You don't have to.Then also think about where are your customers typically when they search for your products or services,think about that from that perspective, from your customers perspective, are they on the couch?Is it something that they're going to be on the road when they're searching and they're likely to beon mobile?That just sort of putting yourself in your customers shoes.If you were going to buy the products and services that you sell, where would you typically be?Would it be equally as likely to be on desktop as you are on mobile or a tablet?Then fine.Then you should be advertising on all devices.But more and more the answer to that question is it's very possible that my customers are searchingfor me on mobile because consumers are now making much more sophisticated, complicated buying decisionsand going through more lengthy, complex buying funnels and buyers journeys.We'll talk about the buyer journey in a following section on mobile devices.And talking about the buyer's journey.What does your buyer's journey look like?Are people making decisions very quickly with one touchpoint?Do people interact with your brand multiple times before they make a decision?Is there a combination of going to see your products in person or meeting you in person?Will they be looking for directions?Right.Are they going to be looking for your interacting with you on mobile?The other question that I'm sort of moving away from is can you spend your budget on desktop alone?So in most cases this advice is still true that if you could spend your budget on desktop alone, thenyou should spend it on desktop alone because you'll typically see higher conversion rates, you'll seelower costs per click on desktop.But budget, in my mind, is really a malleable thing, right?If you're hitting your profitability targets, your budget should be increasing.That's really how it should go.It's very rare where like you approach somebody or you have this attitude that, Oh, no matter howmuch money I generate, I'm not willing to spend more.So if you do have a limited amount of money that you're willing to spend, regardless of how profitableyou are, then try to spend that on desktop first and then to get a really good sense of this.Take a look at what your competitors are doing.We're going to show you how to use SEM, Rush and other research and analysis software that we use totake a look at what competitors are doing, where they're spending, researching their advertising footprint,seeing where they're getting the bulk of their traffic from, what devices and networks their ads areappearing on and looking at what your top three or four competitors are doing, where they're showingtheir ads could give you a really good indication of where you should be playing as well.And the last thing to remember is attention spans are much shorter on mobile compared to desktop, andthat could be a symptom and also an effect of the of the device, because sometimes we're just in amobile context and when we're on our mobile phones are typically more in a rush on the road driving,walking, running, whatever it may be.And on a desktop computer, we're typically either at work and we have all the time in the world toto buy random crap online.We all know how that goes or we're home and we're working and in a more stable set environment.Let me address tablets real quickly.So what's the deal with tablets now?This chart you're looking at on the right hand side is actual real data that was pulled from millionsand I mean, millions of I mean literally millions of clicks from the accounts that Adventure Mediamanages.And we're managing millions of dollars of ad spend.So on the right hand side is conversion rate.On the left hand side is your average cost per click.This was obviously taken from accounts.We took out accounts that didn't have conversion tracking set up properly, etc..And we're seeing this interesting trend when it comes to conversion rates.So conversion rates, when it comes to computers, computers have the highest conversion rate.Then mobile devices have a conversion rate sort of below that.And then tablets are even below mobile devices.Tablets have the worst conversion rate, but you don't see that same trend with cost per click.You would expect to see the same trend with cost per click.Computers have the highest cost per click.When we did this, now we're seeing mobile devices actually have higher mobile traffic being more expensive.And that's we're seeing a lot more variability of that.The mobile devices from the data set that we're pulling has a lower CPC and then tablet actually hasa higher CPC than mobile devices, although it has a lower conversion rate.So we're seeing this inverse relationship between CPC and conversion rate, which is strange.So what's going on with tablets?Again, this was done with hundreds of client accounts, over 4 million clicks, and you see this steepdecline in conversion rate from desktop phones to tablets with phones.We can understand they're small devices, they're difficult to navigate.Your thumbs are are sometimes large and you can't click that button.But what's the deal with tablets?Why are tablets performing so poorly?And this is something we've seen over hundreds and hundreds of accounts.So my advice would be don't bid on tablets to begin with, especially if you have a limited budget,right.If you're not going aggressive, you don't have research and development budget.I would knock out tablets.That is my advice to you.My student put a negative.I don't show you how to do that in a moment.Putting -100% bit of judgment on tablets to start off with to explain why this is happening.I think tablets have a bit of an identity crisis.Responsive design, in my opinion, is the culprit here.For those of you who may not be familiar, responsive design refers to a design framework where youdesign a website or a landing page for a desktop device.And as you get narrower and narrower as the browser plane narrows the content reformat and resizes right,we've all seen that happen.We've all been on sites where that's happened and most of your web, you know, your Squarespace andyour your WordPress sites are going to be responsive.Responsive templates.It's it's very common.But the problem is the breakpoints, which is the the widths of the browsers where content, contentre formats and designers themselves focus on desktops and they focus on phones.There's this grey area, there's this abyss between an iPhone and a desktop where designers and templatedesigners.NOOR And that's called tablets.You always have this weird, weird layout.You have these large backgrounds with tiny little bits of text on white iPads where it's like formattedfor a phone, and then you have text on top of each other because it didn't reformat properly, becauseit's a little bit narrower than a desktop.And I think that bad user experience is the number one reason for suffering conversion rates by device.I don't see how there's a specific.The difference in the attitude of somebody or the personality of somebody using a tablet versus usinga phone versus using a desktop.Not not such a difference where it should account for these numbers so consistently across so many clicksand so many accounts.But I've seen such poor experiences on tablets and it makes sense that people are just not comfortableusing sites.Websites are now getting really good on phones and they're really good on computers.They're just not good to use and not fun to use and not enjoyable to use or easy to find the informationon tablets.I believe that tablet traffics will and should get better as more brands redefine their responsive experiences.So as you as designers are more cognizant of mobile traffic and tablet traffic than than tablet trafficwill likely increase in profitability and the conversion rates will probably increase as well.I want to show you a couple interesting tools.There's that I like mobile test me and browser stack.These are really great tools for testing how well your site content shows up on different devices.So let's jump into mobile, test me over here.And I could choose the free version.I can choose any of these different these devices.And of course, they're given me all these old devices.If I chose a newer device, I could sign up for a very, very affordable paid program to test your devices.But say, I'm going to test the HTC one, which is probably similar to an iPhone six or even an iPhoneten or whatever.I could choose one of these websites, The New Yorker, let's say, to see how it looks.And it shows me that specific device and I can scroll how it looks.The New Yorker looks great.So let's say I did our site adventure ABC.com and I clicked Enter.So it shows me exactly how adventure People.com looks on a mobile device.And it looks fantastic, you know, nice, nice and mobile optimized.If I choose options, I could turn this into landscape, let's say, and I could see how the websitelooks on in a landscape format.Right.Looks really good.And I could also change my device so I could change it.I want to see, let's say on an iPad mini in landscape or I might want to see how and this is if youhave a website and you're in charge of website, this is a great tool to use to diagnose any potentialissues.We spent a huge amount of time and effort designing the site for each breakpoint, so it's a reallygood experience.We have good conversion rates across all devices, but most sites will see a large degree of variability.There's another website which is great called Browser Stack.This is a little bit more of a full service infrastructure for testing.I would recommend signing up for the free trial.You could again, you could sign up and you could actually use your website, use your web app in differentenvironments.It's really, really neat.It's it's more expensive.It's more of an enterprise sort of solution.If you take a look at pricing, I mean, it's not crazy.It's it's $29 a month.It's but it's an actual software.And there's a lot more that you could do.You could test different things live, you could do speed tests.You could test all different types of environments, different operating systems.Meaning I'm on a mac, but I could test how my site would operate in Windows through browser stack.It's really neat through all different types of browsers, something worth checking out if you're interestedin that sort of thing.But at the very least, you should be testing how your site performs on something like mobile test megoing back into a live Google Ads account.We can go and select devices under ad schedule and we can see exactly where we have these device adjustmentsset up.So in this campaign, we actually are advertising on tablets, but as you can see, the tablet conversionrate is lower, but the cost per conversion, in our example, $42 for this specific client is acceptableto us.But if I wanted to knock out tablets, I would navigate to devices under the campaign that I'm in andI would click edit and I would decrease.I would click edit and I'll click decrease and I would decrease my tablet bit by 100%, which meansnow I will start getting zero traffic on tablets for want to remove that I edit.And I leave it blank and I click save and now I don't have any more bit of just been for a tablet.So these are the three categories they don't ever change mobile, mobile phones, computers, tablets.For this client, we have a 15% adjustment increase for mobile phones and a 35% decrease for desktopcomputers.And if can that was an arbitrary we ran the campaign straight.We did we started off running on tablets, computers and mobile phones without any bit adjustments.And then over time, we saw that mobile phones were performing so much better and computers were a littlebit more expensive and weren't performing as well.So we had to decrease our bids quite significantly on computers, increase them significantly on mobilephones, and you can see that reflected in the data here.I click the rate on mobile phones are much better.Our average CPC is starting to evened out, but computers are still a bit more expensive.We get a lot more conversions on mobile and our conversion rate is actually also better on mobile phonesthan it is computer.So all the data corroborates why we went and our cost per conversion was $2 more expensive, and thatcorroborates why we ended up creating a -35% bit adjustments again for this campaign.Another campaign, even if it's a similar product, it might have a different location targeting, setting,it might be advertising, a slightly different service or a different landing page.We might see different results.And we don't have a -35% bit of judgment on computers or we have an opposite maybe in another campaignfor this client, we have a bid decrease for mobile and a bit increased for computers, but that's notso common.Usually you'll get for your business and the services that you're in and the the niche that you operatein, you'll typically see you'll start getting your start, you'll start seeing a good pattern for tablets,computers, mobile phones, how they operate.And again, to create those bit adjustments, you go over to devices.It used to be that you created your bid adjustments and your bid settings at the campaign creation levelwhere we're at in the course.But Google removed that.But I still thought it was worthwhile to to at least introduce my thoughts on tablets, my thoughtsshowing you some interesting analysis, my thoughts on on bid adjustments in general.And again, it's not binary.It's the same thing as location targeting.It's not either I'm advertising on tablets or I'm not.I can have a -20% adjustment, right?Use as much of what you could use to your advantage.Advertising as many places as possible.Advertise on as many devices.Just use your bit adjustments to make that as profitable as possible without having to necessarily totallycut out a location or a time of the day or device category.So the only time I am going to stick to my guns and say it's binary is the display network, right?Remember way back in the beginning we said we're not going to advertise on the display network at all.Stick with that.Do not add display network to your campaigns, even the search partner networks.Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.But that's that.In the next lecture, we're going to briefly talk about tracking templates and custom URL parameters.It's going be really quick as it's not so relevant to us right now.And I will see you guys there in a couple of seconds.
