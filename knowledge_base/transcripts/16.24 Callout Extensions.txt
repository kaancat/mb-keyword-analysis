# 16.24 Callout Extensions

How do you Google that's fans.And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about call out extensions and what they are.You should definitely use them because it just gives you extra real estate on the search engine resultspage and they're super easy to set up.So let's just jump into our slides real quick and I want to show you a little bit about what that isright over here.Maserati lease deals.This is actually a client of ours and we have one, two, three, four called extensions plus four,slightly extensions plus a location extension.Right.So a really good looking at these extensions could be set at the add group or campaign level.So you can have special specific ad specific call outs at the aggregate level, similar to site linkextensions, they can be used to highlight special offers, promotions, things that are sort of evergreencall outs about your company by your services, whether you do free shipping, 100,000 students, 500clients, an average 4.8 star review, you know, new features for 2019, the best pizza on the WestCoast or whatever, things like that, call outs, they're easy to edit.They won't reset statistics.So if I go and change a site extension, it's going to wipe out my statistics for that site extension.I'm not going to I'm going to lose the data with regards to impressions, clicks, so on and so forth.For that, for that site, for that slightly extension, there's a 25 character limit to suddenly extensions,and you could customize them for mobile devices as well.You could schedule specific call it extensions like we were able to do for signing extensions.And just a pro tip before we go in back into the Google Ads dashboard, use your ad copy for detailedbenefits and features, call outs for for promotion.So your call out shouldn't be looked as as like an extension of my ad.Like when I'm writing my my description and my headlines, it's going to be really like specific salesmanship.What am I really trying to accomplish here?The call outs are just extra throw in benefits, the cherry on top just to get some more space.Let's go quickly back into Google ads and take a look at what adding a call ad extension actually lookslike.Here we are back in the dashboard and I'm going to go and add a new call out extension.And it's going to look very similar to what we did with signing extension.So let's say I want to write multiple colors and I'm thinking about these office chairs and advancedoptions.I could device preference for mobile.I can have a start and end date and I could also have days and hours when I want to schedule a callout.And again, the same exact theory applies to scheduling and start and end dates as it does for extension.So there's no need to go through that again.And if I click preview, I can get a little preview of what that site link of what that call out extensionmight look like.So I see multiple colors on a mobile device.Great.So now I could save that and I could add a couple other call outs.Maybe I'll add free shipping worldwide.Maybe I'll add something like 30 day money.It's going to be like a guarantee is too long.30 day.30 day guarantee.Um, £400 capacity because that would be for our office chairs.I'd say that would be an office chair specific and a click preview.Again, I could see what they would all look like.Right.And then I still have my headlines, my descriptions, so on and so forth.So you could add like ten, 12 call outs.That's what I recommend.Let Google rotate.I've actually seen ads that have eight call outs.Most of them will get four.Sometimes they won't get any.Another thing to remember you don't control when your extensions show and which extensions show whenand how much of your extensions how much of your extensions show.So you might have an ad, you might have something extensions called extensions, location extensions,phone call extensions.But you'll only get two sailings or you'll only get your call outs.You'll get two of your call outs and three of your filings.Right.There's a lot of different permutations and ways that this could ways your your ad extensions couldplay out, but you don't have control of how it happens.That's just that's just the way it is.So those are called extensions.Really good idea to add them.I don't see any reason for any campaign or ad group to not have a bunch of extensions.You just get that extra real estate, get the additional space on the SERP, that is your job, increasethat click through rate, which increases the quality score, which increases your your decreases yourcost per click and will decrease your cost per conversion and increase your return on ad spend.And so all beautiful good things in the name of of advertising profitably.In the next lecture we'll talk about call extensions and we'll be moving on from there.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in a couple of seconds.
