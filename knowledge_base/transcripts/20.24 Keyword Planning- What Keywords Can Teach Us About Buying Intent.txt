# 20.24 Keyword Planning- What Keywords Can Teach Us About Buying Intent

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.I just want to continue on the same topic we left off with a couple of minutes ago in the last lecturediscussing the different stages of the bias funnel, but more importantly now drilling into specificbuyer psyches and what those search terms that sort of categorize buy by buyer psyche, where they wherethey fall in the different stages of the bias funnel.Now, I want to point something out.The type of query or the buyer psyche doesn't necessarily relate to any one of these specific buyersfunnels buyers funnel stages every single time.It's not as if the question itself type of query is always going to match up with the shop stage ofthe buyers funnel or informational queries will always match up with awareness stage, for example.That's not the case.You have to be able to assess everything on a query by query basis so you can understand where theyfall in the stage of the buyer's funnel.And it's important to do that for a couple of reasons.One is that we're looking to create these thematically.Related.Keyword groups.Oh, that yellow is a little light to see, but you could see it thematically related keyword groups.That's the whole idea here.That's what we're trying to ultimately accomplish.Another reason is that we want to bid more aggressively.On better keywords that are more in the shop and interest stages of the funnel.And ultimately the reason why we, we want to bid is because those keywords and those search terms aregoing to create is going to generate traffic that has a higher conversion rate.And usually a lower CPA cost per acquisition, cost per conversion.And therefore, we want to have a good understanding of our search terms, sort of where they fall intothe different stages of the funnel.So let's take a look at some of these examples that we have here.So office chairs with lumbar support.Where would you think this search query falls in on the stage of the bias funnel?And you could take a moment to sort of think about that.I would say it either falls into the interest stage of the funnel or perhaps even into the shop stageof the funnel where somebody is specifically looking for office chairs with a specific feature.They're not they're most likely not looking for more information.It certainly sounds from the queer that they're looking for a product or that they're looking for aservice.If it's a service based if you're a service based business.But this specific query, it looks like somebody is searching for a specific product.So they're either in the interest phase where they're like but probably closer into the shop phase becauseagain, they are looking for that product.How can I fix my back problems from sitting all day?I would say that this is a pretty clear demarcation of somebody who is in the interest phase.They're clearly they're already aware of the problem.They write.They're aware that they have a back problem and they are aware that the problem comes from sitting allday and they're now sort of expressing that emotional interest in fixing that problem.Right.So it's it's a keyword you want to bid a little bit more on than if it was somebody just expressingsomething totally generic, but not as much as you would bid on a keyword for somebody who is lookingto buy something.And that's going to be reflected in the historic data in your account.Say Somebody searches for my back, hurts at work.All right.So this is something that I would sort of say is in that awareness phase, right?Very, very generic.We don't know if that person is looking to buy a chair.We don't know if that looking that person is looking to buy a better mattress.We don't know if that person is looking to go to a doctor.We don't know if that person's even looking for a solution.We don't or we don't even know if he's willing to pay for a solution.Maybe he's looking for a blog post.Maybe he's looking for a free YouTube video.Right.Maybe he's searching for information.For our class project.Who knows?It's so general.At best we could say it sort of fits into that awareness stage of the funnel, which doesn't mean thatwe don't want to bid on it, it's just that we want to be very conservative.If we have a limited budget, we don't want to bid on it at all because we really want to focus.We want to make sure that we're getting as much of the shop and interest keywords as we are.But now I understand.I could say that the reason I can tell my client or I could at least have it have a have an understandingthat the reason why this is not a great search term, the reason why this is not acute, we want tobid aggressively on the reason why this is going to be grouped in a certain ad group is because if youlook at the buyers funnel, I could say now with with a certain degree of professionalism and sophisticationthat this person is in the awareness stage of the funnel.My back hurts because I sit for too long in an uncomfortable desk chair.This is similar, but it's most likely awareness bordering on bordering on interest.Right.So he's the he or she is searching and saying that I sit in an uncomfortable desk chair.That's the problem.Or that's that's the the the cause of the problem that I have.And just by the very nature that he's performing a search like this that's so expressive is could beindication that he's in that interest phase.And it also makes it much more valuable for Poppen.Why does it make this much more valuable for popping than this previous search term, which was a descriptionof the problem?Very, very simple reason is because he's using the word desk chair in his query and he's expressingthat he thinks that the the potential solution to his problem is a better desk chair, or at least thecause of his problem is the current desk chair he has.Again, it's not a bottom of the funnel keyword because he's not he's not looking to buy.He's not expressing commercial intent.He might be you know, he might think that a better a better desk chair is not going to solve this problem.This person might think that he just is sort of doomed to a life of bad back problems and chairs.But maybe he could solve it with a better mattress.Or maybe he could solve it by going to a chiropractor or getting a massage or whatever it may be.So, again, it's it's it's interest.It's interest in solving the problem.Maybe it's even awareness.It's certainly not expressing an interest to shop right now, and it's certainly not going to be somethingthat we're confident will lead to a conversion for us.Now, we take a totally different type of search term brand name, product names, poppin max, midback task chair.What do you guys think that buyer funnel for this keyword is?You should know this right away.This is a really easy one, right?Obviously, they're shopping, right.Obviously, the person has already expressed interest.He's already cognitively aware of the problem he is now.And and that stuff is not even important to us.Right.What he exactly views the problem is and that's another important thing to to to focus on.We don't necessarily know what problem this guy is trying to solve.We don't necessarily know is this Jessica who who is having back problems or is this Jessica who's buyinga new thing for her coworker?Or is this Bradley, the entrepreneur who just moved into a workspace and wants a different chair?We have no idea.But it doesn't matter, right?Because we're because we have something better.We have commercial intent.This is the beauty of Google ads to begin with.We're able to capitalize on keywords that have an enormous amount of commercial intent.So we're going to want to bid aggressively, the most aggressively when people search for brand nameproduct parts, we want to bid the most aggressively.Why?Because it has the highest chance of conversions.We have the most likelihood of getting a sale.But the other reason why we have to be the most aggressively is do you guys know is because our competitorsare also going to be bidding very aggressively.Again, Larry and Sergey up in up in Mountain View are not arbitrarily creating prices of these auctions.It's all an open, competitive landscape.So if we have to bid aggressively, that's because our competitors are bidding aggressively.And I wanted to point out over here in this case, it's a little bit different because this is a brandedsearch.And when it's a branded search for our specific brand, then we're going to have a very low cost perclick and an extremely high conversion rate.But you have a lot of brand name product parts that are not your specific brand.So let's say you sell televisions, right?So, so let's say Samsung.You know, 4K, old TV, right?So you sell them, but lots of other companies sell them too.So that's a brand name, that's a product part that would definitely fall under this category.You're going to have to bid very aggressively to get that spot on the page because your competitorsthat also sell the same product are also going to be bidding aggressively because they're all capitalizingright here.They're all capitalizing on the intent to buy that the user is expressing that they're in that shopstage of the funnel, informational queries, online desk chairs, websites that sell to office chairs.Those are almost all typically somewhere between interest and shop.All right.And that's where, again, 80% of your account is going to lie.It's going to be figuring out online desk chairs that's probably leaning more towards shop websitesthat sell office chairs that might be leaning a little bit more to interest.They're looking for websites.They're looking to browse multiple different websites.Maybe they're still in that interest stage, really developing the desire to buy.Maybe they're sort of in that shopping stage already that they're now actually comparison shopping.They made the commitment thing to realize it's very, very hard.It's almost impossible to really know.You're not going to be able to predict with 100% accuracy exactly what stage of the buyer funnel a personis is a person is in based on what they search Google for.It's just not going to happen.You're going to have to peg to the best of your ability what query represents, what stage of the buyersfunnel.And it's not going to be a perfect science, but you're going to have a pretty good ability to understandand you'll be pretty accurate.If you use these tools that we've been talking about, you'll know, is this person likely in the awarenessstage, the interest stage, the desire slash slash shop phase of the buyer funnel?And then as a result.What can I predict?My conversion rate to B, what can I predict my bid should be?How aggressive do I want to be?What areas do I want to focus on optimizing?And then you'll have a structure for your ad groups that could really, really be profitable, highlyorganized.And again, going back to what we spoke about a few lectures ago to remember exactly which lecture wasin, but making the most of your time, you want to focus your time on making sure that the keywordsthat represent people that are in that interest, desire, shop stage of the buyers funnel are the onesthat you're really tight on.You have the right ad copy, you're sending them to the right places of the site.You're making sure you have the highest possible impression share and you spend the bulk of your timethat you have to optimize your campaigns, focusing on those keywords and keywords that are in the awarenessstage, interest stage.You should have them bid conservatively and you should certainly focus on them, but they shouldn'tbe the the primary target of your optimization efforts, so to speak.In the next lecture, we're going to continue on with keyword planning.For a little bit.We're going to look at the Google keyword planner again to sort of see how we can get volume and costestimates for certain keywords, how we could import campaigns back into AdWords using Google KeywordPlanner.And then we'll also take a look at Sam Rush, a really great software that could help us for our keywordplanning stage.And then we'll be on the keyword organization, we'll go into Excel, we'll create our thematicallyrelated groups of keywords.And by the time we're done, you guys will be absolute experts in all things keywords and Google ads1,000% in the top 1% of practitioners.If you guys could really retain and understand all this information and more specifically communicatethis information to your clients, to your boss, to your coworkers, to your friends.And it's really, really worthwhile.And I know that a lot of this might might seem a little bit repetitive and it might seem a little bitrudimentary.But in fact, having this foundation strong and clear will help you understand things that will helpyou understand when things get more complex later on, when there's more complex optimization techniques,more analysis, more data to look at, because you're going to understand, oh, all of this data makessense because I understand how my keywords are structured, and you'll see that all come together asyou get more data in your account and as you go and as you go into auditing accounts that have years,let's say, of historic data, having these fundamental strong is really useful and it's really important.So I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
