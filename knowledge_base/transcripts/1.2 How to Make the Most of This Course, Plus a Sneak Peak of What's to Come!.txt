# 1.2 How to Make the Most of This Course, Plus a Sneak Peak of What's to Come!

How do you Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, I want to do a couple of quick things, but first and foremost, I want to say thatthis is a lecture that you could technically skip.I've gotten criticism in the past for spending too much time getting things off the ground, doing differenttypes of giving over different types of information that I think is relevant, that I think is importantfor a beginner.But if you want to skip right into creating an account or even further than that, by all means, goahead.In this lecture, I'm going to primarily give you a sneak peek of a couple really, really cool Googleads scripts that I'm going to cover in more detail later on in the course.And just briefly, to start off before that sneak peak, briefly, how to how to make the most out ofthis course?I know I covered this in the last lecture, but again, feel free to jump around if you need be beginnersgo step by step.I recommend watching a few lectures at a time, not watching too many lectures at a time to let theinformation sink in.Review any information you need to know.You could Google any information if you want some supplemental information on any topic that's coveredthat don't I don't think that's as much of a factor in the beginning.But once we get into formulas and once we get into more advanced topics like conversion tracking, youreally want to let that information sit so, you know, so you can retain it.So without further delay, let's jump in.And I want to and I'm doing this for a very specific reason.I'm going to jump in and go really, really advanced right now.I'm going to show you a couple of very high level JavaScript, Google ad scripts, how they're actuallyfunctioning in an account.And I'm doing that for a very specific reason, and I'll let you know that reason right after I showthem to you.But I think this is going to be really exciting.So let's jump over to the computer screen into Google ads and take a look at a couple of really powerfulscripts.Here we are in a Google Ads account.This is a live Google Ads account of a client of ours.As you can see over the last couple of months, they've spent almost $800,000 in Google ads.And this is actually only one of the three or four campaigns we're managing for this client.They spend quite a bit of money.And when you're getting a campaign at scale and you have lots of keywords, and even if it's a smallercampaign, even if it's fewer keywords, it's important.One of the most important things is bidding properly.And we're going to talk about the AdWords auction and how the auction works and the dynamics of theauction and quality score, ad rank, actual CPC bidding, automated bidding strategies, all that goodstuff.But fundamentally, you need to know how much do I want to pay for an impression?What is the most I'm willing to pay if I were to receive an ad click?And it's often difficult if you're if you're bidding on a manual CPC basis, which means you're choosingyour telling Google for every specific keyword how much you want to pay.It's often difficult to manage huge sets of keywords, even if it's a smaller set of keywords, it'sit's difficult to manage exactly what you want to bid for a specific reason.Every keyword represents a different buying potential.Every keyword represents different value.Keywords have bids.Every keyword and every search term represents a different likelihood for customer to buy.For example, if you're selling picture frames online, right?So if somebody searches for frames or picture frames or framing shop or something like that, that mightrepresent a certain type of commercial intent.But if if someone searches for 24 by 36 inch black glossy picture frame on sale online, that obviouslyrepresents a lot more commercial intent.And you want to bid more to get that click because they're more likely to buy.And you could use your intuitive sense in the beginning to anticipate that, but over time you'll havedata in the account that corroborates those suspicions you have about how keywords and search termswill perform.So what what people tend to do when you're managing a lot of keywords, you'll put a typical bid, you'llsay a $2.I'm willing to pay at most $2 per click.But there's a big problem with that, right?You're really under bidding on your best search terms and best keywords.You're under bidding when somebody has that really, really good long tail keyword that, you know,will convert at a 15% conversion rate and you're over bidding that $2 is an over bid on a search term.That is like OC framing, framing shops, whatever, where you still want the impression you still wantthat click, although it's not as likely to convert, maybe the conversion rate will be like 7% or somethinglike that.So you end up using this average $2 bid and it's not really doing enough for you.It might be working, but it's not.You're not really having your advertising dollars work at maximum capacity, let's say.Right.You really what you really want to do is have a $3 bid and be in position one on the page for that reallybottom of the funnel keyword.And you want to have a lower bid and be in position, let's say, three on the page for a lesser keyword.So there's a really cool AdWords script.I'm sorry, Google ads, I catch myself sometimes there's a really cool Google ad script that I'm goingto show you exactly how to do in Google.Ad scripts are JavaScript codes that allow you to program unique functionality into your Google adsaccount.It's not.It's high level stuff.It's not a typical feature.It's not something which is available through point and click.You need to know JavaScript to write scripts.We've actually written some pretty cool scripts here at our agency and there's a lot of interestingfree scripts available online as well, and you need to know how to use them and when to use them andin what places to use them.But it's a really advanced thing and it could have massive positive impacts in this account that we'relooking at.The script that I'm about to show you in more almost doubled the.Conversion rate from the account.It saved the client.I actually have this in a spreadsheet.It save the client on average 80 to $90000 of ad spend every month just by making the actual maximummaximum CPC bids at every keyword more efficient and more appropriate for that specific keyword.So this script I'm going to look at is called the bid to bid to average position script.And what it allows you to do, it allows you to choose what position you want any keyword to be in.If you're aiming for position one on the page or position two on the page or position three on the page,it allows you to choose what position you want that that keyword to be in, and it allows you to choosethe maximum bid you're willing to pay to be in that position.And you could run that script automatically every hour and every single hour.24 seven While you sleep.Google will be looking at all the keywords, what position you want them to be in, looking at the lasthours data, or going further back if it needs more data and automatically adjusting that max CPC bidto aim for that position.It's an incredible script.So if you have a top of the funnel or more peripheral keyword that doesn't have as much commercial intent,you might aim to have that keyword in position three because you don't want to overpay for positionone on the page.Position one is more expensive typically, and although it gets more clicks, it's also typically moreexpensive.It's a greater it's a better piece of real estate.And we'll talk about page position in another lecture.And it also allows you to now bid more aggressively on those keywords where you want to be in positiononce.Let me show you quickly what that script looks like.So I'm going to click Get.It's a cool shortcut in the new Google ads interface and type in scripts and hit Enter.And we're going to see a bunch of different scripts that we have loaded into this account.So over here we have our script name and you could edit script names.But here's our bid to average position script and I'm going to click to go into the script so we cansee the details.So over here we see the actual JavaScript output of this script.I see that my max boot is $9.That's the most I want my max CBC bit to ever go to.I could change that to $12 right now if I want, and that totally changes the dynamic of my script.So let's say I do change that to $10.For example, my minimum bid is the least I would ever want the script to lower my bids to first pagebid, and then there's a bunch of other settings and potential ways you can customize the script aswell as we scroll down the page and we'll get more into that as well.Now, if I want to preview what would happen if I run the script, I'm going to click preview and wesee that a bunch of changes were made.So the keyword oxygen concentrator was moved from 264 to 259.Portable oxygen went from 535 to 556.These are all changes that are being made based on data or these are previews of changes that I couldmake if I were to run this script in real time.And now if I click Run, I'm going to click Run.And what's incredibly cool about this is that this could function on thousands and tens of thousandsand even hundreds of thousands of keywords across an account while you sleep perfectly, adjusting yourbid to the penny to get the best possible results in your account.Once I run the script, I'm able to see the results and the results log.I can go back to my rules of the script.I can go back to my scripts and I could see under here where it says frequencies.I have it running hourly and I could have this running once daily, weekly, monthly or hourly.I choose to have this script specifically running hourly.And don't worry, later on in the course under the scripts section, I'm going to give you the exactoutput of the script, and I'm going to walk you step by step how to create a new script in your account,how to load it in, how to test it, but most importantly, how to go back into your keywords and assignthe position labels to each keyword.So this works with that script.So that's a really, really cool script.I want to show you another script.This other script I'm going to show you all the competitive analysis script is also an incredibly,incredibly helpful script for winning new campaigns, but also for researching the advertising footprintand getting a sense of where you stack up against your competition.It's something that clients always really care about to see.And I'll tell you a true story real quick.This this happened just two or three weeks ago.We were invited to submit a proposal for a really, really big account.And this would be the largest account that our agency had ever won.And we knew that we were up against a couple.I won't say their names, but a couple really, really good agencies.And in fact, when we when we pitched the client, we met the client in our conference room right backthere.I told they told us, like, you know, we're actually taking proposals from this agency and that agency.And I was like, wow.It's like usually like I feel really confident those agencies happen to be really good.I said, I think we're really good or I think we're as good, but those agencies are really good aswell.And long story short, we did win the account and it was an incredibly exciting thing.We all felt really, really good about that.It was it was a real milestone to be able to win an account of this size, enormous amount of spend,enormous amount of different campaigns to manage.And what was impressive to this client as they communicated it to us was that we actually were ableto show them this competitive analysis output with charts and graphs.But between you and me, it was a script.They didn't I don't think it would have taken away if they would have known it was a script, but itlooked like a lot more actual time was put into it than really was.I think it took two or 3 minutes max to do this from start to finish, and it created an incrediblyinsightful output of charts graphs showing how they stacked up against their competitors on a bunchof different dimensions over time, and how their change in bids and price in the auction has affectedwhat their competitors have been doing.So let me show you what that looks like real quick.And again, this is just a preview.I'm going to show you step by step later on how to actually set this up in a Google sheet, how to runthis script in Google ads, how to download the right campaign and auction insights reports so the scriptcould actually work as it should work.But let me show you what it looks like really, really quick and give you a brief overview.Overview, because I think it's really, really cool and I'm excited to show it to you.So back at the computer, this is from some time ago, but it's an actual client of ours that's spendingagain quite a bit of money on on PPC.And we were showing how their data has tracked over the course of a number of months.And I'm going to show you, you could break this down by by month, by quarter by day, by year.I'm going to show you how to do that.This chart is broken down by month, over a few months.It shows the average CPC and you have the raw data.This is you, you as us, this is our company.And these other columns are the other companies that showed up in the auction against competing withour clients.You get Amazon frames by mail.Michael Dotcom, Hobby Lobby, Custom Frame Solutions.Those are the five most aggressive or most similar competitors in the auction.Down here we have this really cool chart showing impression share.How often one of these other companies received an impression as a proportion of the auctions in whichwe were also competing.So this dark black line across here is us, is our client, and we want to see which over time whichof the competitors are not necessarily overlapping with us the the most.But if these competitors this is the simplest way to say it if these competitors had the same keywordsin their account as we do in our account, how many more impressions would we have won over them?So we see that Amazon is really up there with us and then they dipped in this month and then came backstronger.Amazon has we'll talk about Amazon, I'm sure a lot.Amazon certainly has a a way of going up and down.We see this competitor down here, Michaels Dotcom started off really, really not competitive at all.They spiked.And over time, Michael has been getting more and more in the auction with us.So we see that Michael is getting more aggressive with the search terms that we're getting aggressivewith over time.So we see that that might be something that affects the dynamic.And you can look through this chart month to month and see how all these different things impacted us.That's how we go to average position.I want to also just point out these are not charts that we built by hand.We ran this script.And all these charts, all these tabs just appeared.That's the power of the script.They literally disappeared.We didn't do any of this by hand.We downloaded a couple reports from Google ads.We uploaded them into a Google sheet.We clicked a couple of buttons.And this is actually a free script that's available.I'm going to give you the exact script and the exact instructions.It just populates all these other tabs for us, showing average position over time how our cost perclick has affected average position, how these competitors have changed their position over time.In this case, it looks relatively stable.We see that Custom Frame Solutions is the most aggressive over time.We see that Michael's is a little bit more erratic.Overlap rate How often?Another participant's ad received an impression when your ad also receives an impression?So which of these competitors is showing up with us the most frequently?So we see Amazon is I'm sorry, frames by mail is actually at the top.While Amazon seems to be competing with us in the most similar keywords overall in the account framesby mail dot com is the one that's clearly the most aggressive with like a 58% average overlap rate.And we see Michaels again is at the bottom of the barrel, but also has been increasing over time.We see that Amazon.com is actually decrease in time with our overlap rate.So we've like over over the course of the last month, we've slightly changed the dynamics of what auctionswere overlapping with Amazon.It's really, really interesting data here.We see that Amazon has dipped a little bit with regards to how often they're overlapping with us andthe auction.Again, we could spend all day going through the just these charts and picking out insights and actionableinsights.But I just want to say how cool this is positioned above rate, how often we were higher on the pagethan the competitor when we both showed up in the same in the same auction.Outranking Share, which is how often our ad ranked higher in the auction than another competitor'sad or a case where our our ad showed and the other competitors ad did not show.We see the competitive breakdown with our top five competitors who's most aggressive in different areas,top of page rate, how frequently our or how often when we shared an impression with a competitor thatour ad up here at the top of the page 123456, seven different really cool charts, really helpful metricswith broken down by month or quarter or year with your average CPC chart, with your five most competitorswith the raw data, this literally took 2 minutes to build because it was just a click of a button andall these charts populated and that was due to the power of a Google ad script, totally customizable.And when you put this in a nice PDF, your client or your boss, or you even look at this for your owncompany, just imagine how practical this information is.Just imagine how impressive this looks.Just imagine how useful really being able to understand.And this is not information you can get easily in the Google Ads dashboard.You could go and look at your auction insights in the Google Ads dashboard.I'll show you how to do that.But to see this broken down by month in this way, with these charts, with the color coding, is somethingwhich is impossible to get from the Google ads dashboard itself.So that's an it's an it's an extremely exciting Google ad script.And again, I'm going to show you exactly step by step how to use this script, how to set it all up.And there's a bunch of different things you have to know, and there's some things that can go wrong.And scripts have a little fickle nature, but when they work, they're quite, quite incredible.So why am I jumping ahead like this and showing you some of the most advanced parts of this course earlyon before we even created our very first Google ads account?Well, there's a reason Udemy tends to ask for a review shortly after.I think the second lecture or the third lecture or something like that.And I think personally it's premature to ask for a review, especially for a course of this length andbreadth.But they do it.What was happening was people were responding to super big intercourse or whatever.And I didn't think that was fair to the to the length and and the complexity that this course is goingto offer.So I'm showing that that this course is really going to cover a lot of advanced topics.I hope that even in the last couple of lectures, you're getting a sense of my teaching style, you'regetting a sense of my enthusiasm, the professionalism of the setup, really.And I mean this honestly, an enormous amount of money, time effort has gone in this professional videocruise lighting, just using the office, the time it takes to put the slides together and to put thecourse material together.It really, really is a lot of work.So if you could take a minute to leave, I hope a five star review with some feedback with a comment,anything that has been helpful to you, I cannot tell you how much that makes a difference in beingable to expose this course to more people.I live and die by student feedback, by reviews.It's extremely, extremely important.So if you could take a moment to leave that feedback, it would be enormously appreciated seriously.So that basically wraps up this lecture from here on out.We're going to start learning and it's going to be great.There's so many topics we're going to cover.We're going to cover things like psychology of search, remarketing, formulas for ROI, calculatingLTB lifetime value of a customer conversion tracking, e-commerce conversion tracking, automated biddingstrategies and semi-automated bidding strategies and manual bidding strategies.Diagnostics.How to go into an account that has a lot of data and figure out what's wrong with it.Is it is it a healthy account?Where do I start making changes?A quality score?What's quality score?How does it affect my campaigns?All that stuff, ad copy, reporting, optimization, schedules?What is the rate and how does it impact quality score using scripts like we just talked about attributionmodels, all attribution models, just time decay linear attribution models first click last click timelag reports.Conversion paths, custom columns, client billing.How to charge for your services How to keep your clients happy, dynamic ad campaigns, dynamic searchcampaigns, audiences, and so much more.I literally ran out of space, and this is like not even scratching the surface of what we're goingto talk about.Call only campaigns, phone call tracking, all different sorts of exciting stuff.It's it's a huge, huge software.And I am committed to going through all the fundamentals.And I think that that's one thing that is unique to my ability to give over this training.I have managed hundreds and hundreds of AdWords campaigns, Google ads, campaigns, literally.And I'm not exaggerating hundreds.I mean, I could show you scroll through the the the computer, hundreds of millions of dollars of adspend since I started my career.Every conceivable niche it's a huge software it's it's a bloated software.There's a million things you could do and there's as many things that are important to understand.There's an equal or if not more amount of things that are useless to you.And I'm going to be able to show you and I'm going to show you what are the useful things you need toknow and what things you don't need to know, what things will just be a waste of your time becausethey're just there to make Google more money and there's a bunch of things like that and, and Googlemight want to, might not want to promote my course after saying that.But let's just be honest, we're not here to make Google more money.Google does make money.We're all working as salespeople for Google.We don't get paid a commission by Google.There's a lot of features and a lot of things and tools and this and that all over the account thatis really there to get you to spend more money on Google ads, and it's not there to help your campaignsdo better.And I'm going to teach you what those things are and how and show you how you should avoid them.So with that all being said.Again.Thank you.This is an incredibly exciting and I will see you guys very soon in the very next lecture where we'regoing to start learning how to make money from advertising online using Google ads.Cheers for now.
