# 20.6 Keyword Match Types- Broad Match

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about the broad match, keyword match type and I'm breaking down.I took the time to create slides and examples and areas for each one of these match types, even thoughyou might have understood them because they're really, really important and it's worthwhile understandingthem at a deeper, more analytical level.Broad match is the default match type.When you create a keyword inside an ad group in Google ads, why?Why would you think broad match is the default match type?Well, you guessed it, because it's going to get you to spend the most amount of money in the fastestamount of time.So broad match is that default match that captures the most clicks and impressions use with extremecaution and care.And I say that to warn you about the amount of traffic a broad match keyword has the potential to pickup.And I've seen a lot of horror stories, but not to dissuade you from using them.Every single ad group, at least to start, should have a mixture of broad match keywords, completelybroad, because it's going to be a great way to great way for you to find new keyword ideas.Negative keywords are an absolute must, right?So if your campaign and your ad groups over time have a lot of broad match keywords a few times a week,depending on the amount of budget, depending on the size you should be going in, going into the searchterms report and adding negative keywords.And once we get to negative keywords, I'm going to walk you through how to find really good negativekeyword ideas using the search terms report.Broad match keywords will typically have the lowest click through rates, but you shouldn't worry aboutlow click rates penalizing your quality score because quality score is weighted.There are two factors with quality score that will be weighted is your position on the page and themass type.So if you have a match type, Google is not going to look and look at what your click rate is on a broadmatch compared to an exact match keyword in a competitor's account.Right.So it's going to be it's going to be a fair playing field.But you should just note it will have the lowest click the rate, which by itself is not necessarilya bad thing because you do want to focus on profit.Here are a couple of examples of broad match keywords and ads that they might that you might show upfor.So Leather Desk Chair, which is similar to our previous example.And ads can show up for searches for free desk chairs, office furniture, desks, chairs, leathercouches, pictures of desks, pictures of desk chairs, used desk chairs.So as you can see, there's a huge range of search terms that can show up for a broad match.Q Would like that?Another quick example.So you have wood corner desk is your search term, it's broad, it's wood corner desk is your keyword,rather is broad corner office for end do it yourself.Desk assembly, plastic desks, corner desks from IKEA wood corner desks for sale online.All sorts of different search terms that a person's typing in might be eligible to remember that eachone of these keywords has a bid.Right?So you're telling Google.You're not telling Google that I want to pay a $2 for corner desks from IKEA.You're telling Google that I want to pay $2 for wood corner desks, and that includes all these potentialranges that will inherit that same $2 bid, all the search terms.You might have thousands of search terms that can trigger one given keyword.Is inheriting that bid and if its target CPA and I want all the all the keywords in this ad group toaim for a CPA of $90.Then Google is going to assume that any given keyword is going to inherit that bid for all these searchterms that are available to you.Let's just run through a couple of pros and cons of broad match.So.First spend less time building keyword lists.Broad match is a great way to quickly load up a lot of suggestions and jumpstart a campaign, collectinglots of data with broad maps.You'll need fewer individual keywords to cover the same range of search terms that you would need withthe phrase match bar match modified an exact match.You can think of every variation, right?You're not going to understand.You're not going to anticipate all the different ways a person, a customer might be searching for yourproducts.All the long tail, long tail search terms refer to sentences that are 1015 words.And again, remember that a keyword can't be more than ten words, but people but ads that are searchterms that are long sentences could still trigger a keyword.Even if they're above ten words.You're not going to think of all the different ways a person might talk and want to look for your productsand services.It's a great way to discover new ideas because you're going to look through that search firm's report.Google will show you through the search terms report.Google will show you all the actual queries that led to impressions and clicks on your keywords.It's one of the most valuable I think it's I would say it's the most valuable report inside the entireGoogle ads interface is that search terms report.And we're going to spend time in it, understanding it and looking figuring out how we could use itto our advantage.A broadband strategy could work great.If you have a large research and development budget, which means you or your boss or your client says,Listen, we're aggressive, we're in growth mode.If you ever hear that we're willing to scale, then, you know, broad match keyword is your best friendbecause broad match keyword is going to do two things.It's going to get you a lot more traffic to your site.It's also going to give you a lot more good keyword ideas quicker.It's also going to give you a lot of good negative keywords ideas quicker.So if you want to have an account that is performing as best as it can in a quick amount of time, broadmatch keyword is actually your best friend.It's counterintuitive because Bournemouth keyword will waste the most amount of your money, but ifyou're able to stomach a loss for the sake of investing in a better performing account, and that'show you phrase it to your client or that's how you should conceptualize it for yourself.Could work is the best way to do that.Broad match keyword should always be used with extensive negative keyword lists and those two thingstogether good negative keyword lists, good negative keyword optimization schedules, doing it on arecurring basis, plus accounts that have a lot of match keywords actually could be a very good longterm result.We have campaigns for clients that are spending a lot of money, and I would say 80 to 90% of theirentire account is all broad match keywords.And that's because we're extremely diligent in adding negative keywords on a recurring basis very frequently,making sure the account is always performing well.Broad match keyword will often give you the cheapest cost per click.That's not necessarily a good thing, but it's just a fact.Why?When I have a broad match keyword, Google's entered me into a full range of searches.So some of those searches will be will have less commercial intent.There'll be more peripheral searches, and they'll be less competitive.Fewer competitors will be bidding on those search terms, which means that they might trigger a broadmatch keyword, even if that even if that exact variation of my broad match keyword is a highly commercialintent keyword.It's a very competitive term.Let's say leather desk chairs for sale online.But that might trigger a search for pictures of leather desk chairs and pictures of leather desk chairsdoes not indicate commercial intent to buy, and the click for that keyword will be much less so inaggregate.My average CPC for broad match keywords over the course of 50 110,000 clicks will typically almost alwaysbe much less than its phrase exact match modified counterparts for that same exact keyword.What are some of the downsides of broad match?As we've spoken about, we're going to spend a ton of money very fast on bad clicks, remember, becauseyou're giving Google total autonomy with matching up search terms with your keyword, you will get alot of irrelevant clicks and traffic.You're going to get clicks.Some of the clicks you're going to get from broad match will be search terms out.Oh, great idea.That's a little bit of a middle of the funnel keyword, but I still want to advertise and that someof them will be way out of left field.You know, let's say you're selling transformer toys.You're going to start getting searches for transformers for the movie and posters of the movie and liketotally irrelevant.And that's and that's something to think about when it comes to negative keywords.Does your product or service have similar names and culture that are typically used for different things?It's a good trick.Make sure to think about that and make sure to add those as negative keywords and make sure you're notspending money on those types of things.We just had that with a client.The client's last name is the name of their business, and it's a it's a pretty famous business.But people were also searching for other people with the same name.And we're making sure to add those names as negative keywords.Low Click The rate can hurt your quality score.As I said previously, you shouldn't be overly concerned with it hurting your quality score becauseultimately broad match keywords are great and you could still have a very high click to rate for keywords.But if you see your click through rate really suffering and it's really far below the average of theclick through rate and the rest of the account.That could be a reason why your quality score for those keywords might be suffering as well.Broad match keywords are the hardest type of keyword to drive direct conversions and brand awarenessbecause you have such little control, because you're telling Google to put me at the bottom of thefunnel searches, but also show me searches for whatever you think might be relevant.Even if the person is not or the user is not expressing as much commercial intent, you're going tohave fewer conversions.Just go into that understanding, that dynamic.It's a great research and development tool.You're going to get good ideas and coupled with good negative keyword lists, but also discipline,negative keyword optimization schedules, you can have a really good account that consists of a lotof broad match keywords a lot of people think of.A lot of people think that either they're not going to use broad match at all or they're only goingto use broad maps in the beginning.But it's seriously a mistake.Broad match keywords can be a really integral component of your overall keyword strategy, and it shouldbe as long as you're on top of it and as long as you're managing them well.In the next lesson, we'll talk about broad matches, older brother, broad match modified, and I'llsee you guys in a couple of seconds on the other side.
