# 14.3 The Principles of a Profitable and Scalable Account

Welcome back.In this lecture, I want to walk you through eight signs of a scalable account.You might be auditing an account and we're going to talk about audits shortly.You might be recently assigned to managing an account and getting sort of a sense of health.You might be wanting to just take a look at your overall account architecture and see, hey, is amI in a good place to increase spend, generate more results, and scale?Because the goal of any Google Ads campaign is not only to generate profit, but to be able to do it.When I spend more money so I can get more of that profit, more sales and more leads.So what are the eight signs of a scalable account?These are what we think.These are what we see.What I've seen over hundreds I would say thousands of accounts at this point.I've been doing this for ten years.And these are the signs of accounts that are really healthy and that can scale.Number one, diligent management and oversight with eyes on and hands off your account every day forhigh spending or every few days for low spend accounts.This is one of those things that seem obvious, but it's not so common.There's a balance between keeping an eye on things every day, but also on your account, spending alot of money, being hands off, allowing the campaigns to optimize.But you as a practitioner, understand and know everything that is happening.Or for lower spending accounts, your maybe every few days making key optimizations.Okay, so that's something which is definitely like you just get a sense, am I doing this?Am I patient?But am I also aware?Number two high quality data passback.Your account is getting good audience signals from your CRM, from your e-commerce platform, customerlists, audience signals, custom intent audiences, micro conversions, conversion tracking, GoogleAnalytics, merchant center.The data coming into Google is high quality.Number three exceptional ad quality.Keyword targeting, audience targeting and landing page experience.These are all the front facing elements of a good, healthy campaign.Your ads are written well.You're not relying on Google's AI to write your ads for you.You have compelling messages.Your keywords make sense.You've done good keyword research, and that keyword research comes from having done industry research.Understanding the the product's audience targeting.This also comes from industry research.Understanding the clients or your products and services.Understanding the behaviors, the patterns, the habits of the people who are in the market for yourproducts or services.You understand the pain points.You understand the problems that your product solves.You understand where you sit in the competitive landscape and your landing page experience.Where are you sending traffic?Is that page optimized?Is it clean?Is it has.Does it have high production quality?Is it is it a good page?So on and so forth.Number four research through consistently analyzing consumer behavior trends and the competitive landscapeto stay ahead.So this is not just a research is not a one time thing.Are you regularly looking at the competition?Are you reading the industry blogs and journals?Are you aware of news that might impact the industry?Are you aware of trends?Of search trends?This is information that you should be staying on top of.I would say at least once a month in a good degree of detail.Number five embracing testing, testing and more.Testing, running experiments, testing different bidding strategies.We have talked in quite a bit about testing, but this is something which is really important.Next, exceptional consumer experience with everything from ads to email marketing to package designto branding.Marketing is a flywheel and there's a halo effect.When you're doing more things right, more of those individual things are going to work.So customer service.Are you running email marketing?Are you keeping your customers aware and engaged with your products and services?Do you have affiliate offers?Um, packaging design?If you're e-commerce, branding, your messaging, the overall look and feel, the polish, the personalityof your brand, all of that's going to matter and all that's going to increase your ability to bid moreaggressively if you could increase your conversion rate on site.A planned out marketing calendar do not go into the year or into a quarter without a marketing calendar.This is going to forecast what you're going to spend in each month of the year, what promotions andsales you might be running, what new services that you might be exploring or introducing over the courseof the year.And that's going to allow you to plan building out those campaigns in advance.And last, an omnichannel marketing approach is important, not just Google alone.We've been talking for hours about Google in particular.Google, for sure is the most important, most profitable, largest direct response advertising companyin the world.But in today's world, it's rare for us to see an account, to see a business succeed.Just relying on Google.There's a there's there's ChatGPT, there is Amazon.There is TikTok and Instagram and Facebook, programmatic and YouTube and connected TV and screens andoutdoor.There's a there's an enormous amounts of pressure and attention that's being diverted away from yoursolution.And you have to not necessarily be active on every one of those channels.That would most likely be a mistake.But think about meta.Think about TikTok.Think about YouTube.Think about the sequence of messaging that's going to ultimately allow a Google search.Click to get more mileage to be more likely to result in a conversion.This goes back to that assisted conversion paths.But assisted conversion paths is just looking at interactions within the Google ecosystem.There are other ecosystems that are important as well.So if you're taking more of an omnichannel approach and you're open and interested in learning aboutand exploring additional channels, additional ways of of engaging with your customers and your prospects,that's going to be a good sign of a profitable and scalable Google Ads account.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about how to run an audit of an account.You get this account.It's this big account.You have tons of campaigns.How do I run an audit and how do I assess quickly the opportunities within an account?I will see you shortly in that lecture.
