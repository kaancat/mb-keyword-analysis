# 16.4 Updated Dashboard Walkthrough

Welcome back everybody.In this module we're going to do a quick walkthrough of the Google Ads dashboard.And I'm going to show you the key areas of the dashboard that you want to learn and really understandwell.But the best way to learn the dashboard is to spend time in the dashboard.The when you first go into Google and you're learning it, it seems complex.There's a lot of buttons, a lot of things you could do, but ultimately it's like Google Sheets.It's a reporting interface.There are filters.There are different ways of checking in on your conversion tracking, setting up different types ofcustom reports, obviously creating and launching campaigns.And Google is constantly changing small features within the dashboard.So the best thing you can do is just spend a lot of time in the dashboard.But instead of going through every single possible feature and function inside the Google Ads UI.I'm going to walk you through the things that really matter the most.After we do a dashboard walkthrough, I'm going to show you the key metrics and reports and the metricsthat matter.Report something that we built custom here at Adventure Media.Something that we use for our clients and we find it extremely effective.So here's an image before we actually get to the dashboard, here's an image of the main Google Adsscreen.You have two vertical menus on the left.Those are the menus you're going to use to to navigate.At the far left is you have your highest hierarchy levels where you can look at high level tools, yourbilling, admin setup, and of course, your campaign.The campaign tab, the one that's highlighted in blue.Here is what you're going to spend the most amount of time on.The second vertical menu to the right is going to change depending on what top level menu item you areon, and you will typically have an additional horizontal menu.Different tabs running horizontally across the screen above the reports that will allow you to see differentinformation.I'm going to show you how to set up campaigns, ad groups, keywords and ads.That's obviously really important.How to analyze results.We're going to talk about filters columns reporting.And then we're going to look at how to navigate to your goals.Understanding the conversion tab the attribution tab.We'll talk more about attribution in much more detail later when we understand and learn about differentattribution models.And then some of the key tools within the Google Ads dashboard like the Keyword Planner, Shared Library,bulk actions, budgets and bidding, and other adjustments that you can make using the tools menus andthen looking at connected accounts inside the data manager.So let's jump in to a Google Ads account and we'll walk around together.So here we are inside a Google Ads dashboard.On the left hand side we have campaigns.This is the key reporting area that you're going to be using the most.On the left are your goals, which are conversions and measurement.You have two additional flyout menus, your tools.We're going to get into tools in a moment.Billing setup and your admin preferences, account settings, security notifications.And again, when it comes to really effectively running campaigns, we're going to be living in thiscampaigns tab.On the left hand side we have our overview.The overview is going to be Google's nice color coded widget report.That's going to show you the key metrics for all of the campaigns in your account by default.So for example, at the top here we have a chart that shows clicks, conversions, cost per conversionand cost for my selected date range.It's always important to remember that your date range lives up here on the right hand side.So any report that we're going to encounter is going to show data.It's going to show reports.It's going to show results.Let's just scroll down.So for example, your performance by day of the week and time of day.So we have the best performance as far as impressions go.Because you could change from impressions to I want to see my best CTR, my best click through rateright.So it looks like my best click through rate at 5.83% is is Saturday around between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.?Now, of course, that's not an insight that I'm going to be putting too much weight behind, but thismight change if I change my date range.Add performance across devices.We have mobile phones, tablets, computers and TV screens, and again, I could change the metric foreach one of these.Um, each one of these charts, each one of these dimensions.So I might want to see instead of cost, I might want to see the total volume of conversions.And this over here is showing me a percentage of conversions coming through mobile, a percentage that'scoming through computers, tablet tablets and computers and so on.So over here I see like this could be an interesting report.44% of my conversions are coming from mobile.55 on desktop.That's something that I might want to consider when it comes to optimizing our site for mobile.I can look at impressions.I can see much more impressions coming on mobile.I can see clicks or average CPC.I see that my average CPC on mobile is more expensive at $3.22.I'm sorry, it's actually less expensive than it is on desktop.Desktop CPC are $6.Mobile CPC are $3.The question might be why?And just to take a step back when you're looking at data, you're not, Google is not giving you thewhy, why something is happening.Google is giving you the what.Google is telling you what is happening.It's important for you as a good practitioner to understand using all of the tools, all the strategies,all the insights, the concepts that we're teaching in these courses.It's up to you to understand and think about why something is happening, and you're never going tohave the right answer right away.All you're going to have is theories.You'll have ideas.Ideas as to why something is happening.Guesses.And the best thing to do is document those ideas.Document those theories.You might have five different explanations.More than likely, the real answer is a combination of multiple guesses and theories.And you're going to use your skills, your optimization techniques, to test whether those theoriesare true, whether those theories are correct.Um, so date range I could select 30 days up until yesterday by default is a good one, last seven daysby default.And of course you could use your custom date range.I'm just going to go back up to type in 180.Days up until yesterday and click apply.So and again I high level I might want to see clicks and conversions over here.You could can look at cost per conversion and add another color.You could look at cost.Each of these menu items have a three dot icon that allow you to opt to edit or export or download thischart, so I can download this chart.This card as a as a CSV or as a as an image.I could break this down hourly.I could break it down monthly.I could look at it all in all in all different, all different ways.Again, you could change these metrics at the top however you'd like.So if instead of wanting to see clicks first, you want to see your conversion rate first, you coulddo that by seeing your conversion rate and then you could follow that blue line.Um, you know, all through the all through the chart, all through the date range.Okay.So this is your overview tab.And again Google gives all sorts of interesting widgets recommendations.I personally don't spend that much time here on the overview.So what I want to look at data I'm going to go into campaigns under this campaigns tab over here andclick campaigns.Now I'm back into my more normal, um, sort of my more normal expected spreadsheet style reporting.And this is the view and the look that you're going to really be most exposed to as you're building,optimizing, and improving your campaigns.On the left hand side, we have a list of our campaigns.Because we're at the campaign level, we have a bunch of columns.These columns are all customizable.We're going to get to that in a moment.Budgets, my status optimization score clicks, and I'm going to talk you through the columns that Ilike, having the best that are the easiest for me, that I just got used to over the years.So here you have a group of campaigns.Anything with blue text is clickable.So I could click on this Boff campaign and if I click it, I'm going to be automatically brought downto this ad groups level menu.And it's going to show me these ad groups inside that specific campaign.And if I forget or I want to understand which campaign I'm in.You look up into this horizontal menu over here.So it shows me that I'm viewing ad groups just inside this one Boff campaign.Now, what if I want to see all the ad groups inside all of my campaigns?So one, I'm just going to remove this segment.We're going to talk about segments in a moment.I'm going to go to Segments and none and just have a clean list of my ad groups.If it's green, it means it's active.If it's if it has a paused signal, it means that that that ad group is currently paused.If I want to see all the ad groups, I'm going to go back to my campaigns tab.I'm going to go into the campaign, um, drop down menu over here under filter campaign statuses all.And under here by by view filters I'm going to click on all campaigns okay.So now I'm back to viewing all campaigns.If I go right into my ad groups menu directly from the campaigns menu without clicking on an individualcampaign, I'm going to have all of the ad groups across all of my campaigns.And there's a new column called Campaign Now, and this campaign column is going to show me the associatedcampaign.Again, it's clickable.So if I want to click on this campaign and see ad groups in it, I'm going to stay on my ad groups tab.But I'm now going to be inside that ad group.I'm going to see just the ad groups inside that campaign.So going back to campaigns, um, again, I can go back to all campaigns up here.I can scroll through my campaigns, I can filter my campaign view.So I want to filter my campaign view.I can click the filter and I can filter by performance metrics.So let's say I want to see campaigns that spent above greater than $500.I'll apply.And now I'm only going to see campaigns that spent in accordance with these filter dimensions.I could add another filter, and there's an endless amount of filters that you can create.I might want to see campaigns that have at least two conversions.Okay, I could remove those filters by clicking the X, and filtering is a really easy and great wayto get a view of a complex account if you're just looking to see big movements.So for example, if I'm, if I have, if I know I have an hour to work on an account or a half hourto work on an account, I want to do things that are going to push the needle.So I want to try to improve the campaigns that are spending the most money.I want to try to improve the campaigns that have the lowest conversion rate.Right.So I might make a filter of all campaigns.I might go into ad groups and make a filter.If I'm in the ad groups tab over here, I can make the same filter.I might want to say I could type in look, I could look for my filter.Like this way.Conversions.Um, conversion rate is below 1%.Okay.And then I might want to see I have a, I have some, uh, ad group status filters up here that I mightwant to say.Okay, I want to look at just just enabled.I want to see the currently enabled ad groups that have a conversion rate of -1%.And the campaign associated with those ad groups are also enabled.And now that brings me down to just two ad groups that I might want to work on.Okay, so here's two two ad groups that I that I see having a very poor conversion rate.And I would look into this.I go into the keywords, I would look at the ads, I would look at the landing pages.But again, my point right now is not to teach optimization techniques.The idea here is to teach the value of filtering.So filtering is what I use when I'm in a, when when I don't have that much time.And I want to just make decisions and, and look into areas of the campaign, whether it's keywords,ad groups, ads or campaigns that need the most work or could use the most attention.Um, okay, so that's ad groups.If I click into an ad group going further down the hierarchy, I'm going to be presented with keywordsand you'll see that the menu, the menu on the left drops us down to this Search Keywords report.So again I'm seeing if I want to get a gut check and just remember what keywords I'm looking at.Where are they?Where are these keywords?Living inside.What ad group?I look up here into this horizontal menu.So I'm seeing the ad group is paid social.I could click and select different ad groups over here.I'm also looking at them inside one campaign.And if I click on this All campaigns button.Now I'm seeing all of the keywords in my account across all campaigns.And now I have these two new columns.I see which campaign the keyword is in and which ad group that keyword is in.So again, here's a report I'll go down to search keywords.I might have a certain date range filter I could click on the top of the column.So if I want to see which keyword has the most clicks I could quickly filter by clicks.I could sort by impressions.I could sort by click through rate.I could sort by any of my columns.And again, if I'm looking to make some keyword optimizations and see a performance that I want to see,hey, am I spending too much on any keywords?So I see my average CPC is 547, so I might I might create a filter.I'm going to click AD filter.I'm going to say CPC.Average CPC is greater than $7.I want to see are there any keywords I'm spending a lot of money on?So I say, okay, so how many keywords do I have here?I scroll down and it shows me total filtered keywords down here.1000, um, total filtered keywords.I have 1963 clicks on this on these keywords, compared to 9000.So about 20% or so of my account is spending higher than average.And if I select here there I could see that there's 38 of these keywords that are spending aggressively.So now I might say, okay, well I'm spending a lot of money on these keywords.I will take a look at my conversion rate, I'll take a look at my CPA, my cost per conversion, I wantto see are any of these keywords like drastically or driving in like a really expensive CPC cost perconversion?Um, I see the average of my filtered keywords is 171.I now know, according to our business metrics, where we want to be.Here's here's a keyword lead generation marketing agency that's generating a $400 CPA.That's a little bit high.All right.So how much did we spend?We only had 51 clicks.All right.Not the end of the world, but it's still $15 a click.Now this is a keyword that I'm going to keep an eye on.So what would I do to keep an eye on this keyword?I might select it and give it a label.And I might say create a label.Um, keep an eye.Keep an eye.Keep an eye.That's called keep an eye.Expensive CPCs and CPAs.All right.So I'm going to create that label.And click apply.And now this keyword has a label.And what does that mean.So let's just say let's just find one more.Um here's a keyword.Here's another one with a $326 CPA a little bit high.I want to keep an eye on this e-commerce PPC agency keyword as well.Go into my labels.I could search for the label.If you have a lot of labels, keep an eye, select it, apply it.All right.Now, if I'm coming back in a week from now and I go back to I start off with my campaigns.Okay, I'm in my campaign report.I want to go down, jump right into my search keyword report, and I want to say, hey, I might havemade like, I'm going to get rid of this filter.I'm going to say all enabled keywords or enabled and pause keywords is fine.And I want to say, hey, I want to keep an eye.I had a bunch of keywords.I had like 30 keywords I added this label to.I want to keep an eye on it, so what can I do?So now we're going to talk about columns at any time in any report.Whether you're in a search keyword report, you're in an audience report, you're in your ads reportcampaigns report, ad group report.We're going back to our Search Keywords report.At any point, you can click this columns button and modify the columns that you see here.So first I'm going to click Modify Columns.And here the the all of the columns that I could add to this keyword report.And there are a lot of columns, there are hundreds of columns that you can add to a report.So by by clicking these little twirly icons, you could see all of the available columns that you canadd, right?Lots and lots of columns.And most of these are columns that I would never add and I'm not interested in seeing.Um, but if I click here and I search for label, I'm going to I have label that I'm adding and I canmove it.Now on the right hand side on this right hand panel, I could move around the columns that I want tosee.Some of the columns are going to be locked.So for example keyword match type, campaign, ad group and status.These are columns that you cannot move and you cannot remove.But say I wanted to add label over here.If there's a column that I don't want.So for example I don't want to see final URL right now I want to see clicks impressions, click throughrate, average CPC cost, conversions by conversion time.No, I don't want that column.I want to see conversion value.I don't want to see that column because we're not running e-commerce.All conversions, conversion rate, cost conversion value divided by cost.That's my return on ad spend.Um, conversions.I don't need conversions in all conversions.Based on how this campaign is set up and cost per conversion.I moved them around a little bit, I edited them.Um, let me look through this column.Let me look through here and see if there's any columns, any columns that I would like to add.Um, so let's see if your e-commerce you're going to want to add value per conversion.Conversion value.Um, again here's the revenue orders.Average cart size gross profit.These are great columns to add if you're running an e-commerce business.Um, I'm going to add view through conversions.Here's attributes like campaign ID.I added a label attribute bid strategy type.I'd like to add um, estimated top of page bid.I'd like to add.You have a bid simulator here, which is great.um estimated additional cost per week.Top of page bid competitive metrics.These are like search.Impression.Share.Search.Impressions.Share.Um for impression search impressions.Top top top of page search lost impression share due to rank search.Lost top impression.Share due to rank search lost.Absolute top impression.Share okay and click share.I happen to like these competitive metrics, so I typically add them.You could add columns from Google Analytics if you're running messaging campaigns, YouTube earned actionsand I like to add quality score, historic quality score, expected CTR, expected, historic CTR,landing page experience, ad relevance, and ad relevance.Historic.Those are the ones I like to do.And now, if you spend some time setting up your custom columns for a search keyword report, I wouldrecommend save your custom columns.So I'll say Isaac.Search keywords, custom view and click Save and Apply.Okay so now it's going to apply.But let's go back to our original task.We want it to search right.We had we had a couple of weeks ago added a bunch of labels to expensive keywords with, with high CPAs.And we wanted to keep track and come back and say, did anything happen?Maybe we lowered the bid, maybe we changed the bid strategy.There might have been 100 different optimizations that we did, and I want to keep an eye and look atthis report so I can now now that I've added the label column, just at a glance, I could see thatthese two keywords are the ones with this label, but I could also filter.So I could click filter, click label, label contains and I could search for my label.So keep an eye apply.And now I'm only seeing the two keywords.And now I could analyze total results so I could see my total filtered keywords have 196 clicks, 6500impressions, 3% click through rate, my average CPC, so on and so forth, and I could see all of myother metrics that I've continued to add all of my other columns.Now let's remove this filter and say, for example, I go to modify, somebody comes in or I come in,I modify my columns, I want to export a clean sheet, and I remove all of these great columns thatI like having in my search term report search.Right.Because I'm going to export something or I want a few things in a certain way, or Google Ads is loadingslowly that day.And I want to get back to my base line columns that I really like.So now I can just click columns and click Search Keyword Custom View.And I'm back right away to my full range of columns that I like to see.Um, and I could again sort by clicks to get this in order.I typically will sort by clicks or impressions or costs just to get a sense of at the top, like, whatare we spending the most money on?What's driving the most amount of traffic?Um, so again, now let's say I'm going to work on the accounts a little bit.I want to see potentially which keywords have a really poor quality score.I can make another filter.So I could say I want to just work on keywords that are enabled.And I'm going to click Add Filter.I'm going to type in quality score is equal equal or below equal or less than three.Okay.So I see my my total filtered keywords 1500 um a 5.74% click through rate.So that's a pretty good click through rate.It's definitely significantly higher than the rest of the account.A $5 CPC, not so much higher than the rest of the account.Um, 59 conversions.But let's see what is our cost per conversion?$131 again, not so much more than the rest of the account.So then I would probably say look like I could work on quality score for these poor keywords, but it'snot like a it's not a severe issue that I have to address right now.And that was a really great insight that I was just able to get from a, from running a filter reallyquickly.Uh, so that's the, that's filtering, that's creating custom columns.Um, and how to navigate through the vertical menus from campaigns to ad groups to ads.And again, you're going to get used to how this looks and how this works the same way with ads, Ican go and create custom columns with ads I could create custom columns with.I could create and modify my columns and filters with the ad group campaign, the campaign tab.And these are the reports that you're going to get a high level view based on your date range of actualresults that are taking place.Um, let's briefly walk through the creation of a new campaign.I know that in a bunch of other modules and lectures we go through the campaign creation setup, butI just want to show you real quick and walk you through some of my thoughts around creating a campaignand from scratch.All right.So look, I'll tell you this from the get go, you could copy and duplicate campaigns.So let's say I know I have certain ads, ad group structure, keywords and a bunch of settings in thiscampaign.I could select it, I can go to edit, I can do command C copy, and I can just click command V.And Google will take a few minutes to paste that campaign as a new campaign.And I'll have the shell of that campaign all built out.But say for example, we're going to create from scratch.So the big blue buttons are going to be your friend.So if you're in the ad group, um, clicking a new ad, clicking the blue button is going to createan ad group adds.Clicking the blue plus button is going to create a new ad, and you're going to have a bunch of differentoptions for the type of ad you'd like to create, whether you're on experiments, etc. the blue buttonis always going to be like create that new thing.Depending on the higher the hierarchy that you're currently in in the menu.So we're going to click create a campaign.So I could either load existing campaign settings.But we're going to create a new campaign from scratch.And this opens up the Google Ads campaign creation setup menu.We talked about all of these options in more detail, but I'm just going to say let's say we're a leadgen business and we are looking to get leads from Google.Right.And the truth is, you're either going to choose sales or leads, right?I'm not a fan of and I don't, and I haven't seen good results from the website traffic campaign, apppromotion, um, awareness and consideration ultimately.Look, we're here to get performance.We're here to drive sales.And Google is going to most effectively reach your audience.If you tell them what you want, you have to tell Google what you're trying to achieve.And it's typically if you're e-commerce is going to be sales, if you're a service based business oryou're a lead gen business, you're going to be getting leads, okay?The next thing you do when you select that leads option, you're going to tell Google what your conversionactions are.So we have already, um set up default account action goals.Now begin checkout.You might be asking why is this here for a lead gen setup?This comes from our account because we have the Adventure Academy where there is a begin checkout actionfor buying online courses.So I'm going to preload this campaign with both of these conversion goals that have been configured.Or I can add a goal.Right now we are going to talk in more detail about conversion tracking setup, how to set up goals,how to import goals over from Google Analytics.It's going to be great, but for now I'm going to leave the submit lead gen forms a goal action configured.You could also continue to create the campaign shell without a goal.That's fine.You could add your goals and your conversion actions later.Click continue.And now I have the option to select my campaign type.Now this is where people get stuck.They get overwhelmed.So let me just make it very simple.If you're a shopping, if you're an e-commerce business, you will likely be choosing shopping, searchor performance Max.If you're a lead gen business, you're going to be searching search or performance max.I would avoid this.I would avoid for now, as you're setting up your first 5 to 10 campaigns and you're spending your first,let's say, 10 to $20,000 a month, if you're spending 100,000 $200,000 a month.Then we're experimenting with all campaign types.But up until then, demand gen display and video.I would not use as an individual campaign type.If you are looking to test performance Max as you should, we're going to be um, you could look in,you could look at the performance Max, and watch the performance Max course.To get a full rundown in detail about everything performance Max has to offer and how to make the mostof it.But you're in for 99% of the cases.You're either going to be using performance max here, search or shopping.I'm going to be creating my first mainstream foundational search campaign.Foundational campaign for a lead gen business.I'm going to be selecting search.Once you select search, you select the ways you Google asks you to select the ways you'd like to reachyour goal.So, um, lead form submissions.That's really my main goal for this campaign.And I'm going to click continue.If you have a local store, you're going to click store visits.If you want to generate phone calls to a call center or to your phone, you're going to select phonecalls.And if you're looking just to get traffic, you're going to select website visits.but I don't think I've ever selected web site visits as an option here.I'm going to click continue.And now we get to name our campaign.So I'm going to name it Isaac Test Search.I usually like to include the campaign type in my name.That just makes it easier.And all of you will develop your own naming conventions.And I suggest that you just do.You take some time, figure out how would you like to name campaigns and ad groups and keywords.Sometimes people use the pipe that taller vertical line.Sometimes I like to use an underscore.People could use brackets and parentheses and quotes.Do it however you'd like.For clients, we would typically put our our AMG um, at the beginning just to show that this is somethingthat we're that that our agency is managing.And you click continue create a new campaign or finish a save draft.I want to start a new campaign.And now Google's going to bring you into the actual setup with settings.And I'm going to run through this really quickly.What do you want to focus on?You could focus on conversions conversion value clicks or impressions.Share.Um, typically you want to focus on conversions.And in this case we're going to focus on conversions.Do I want to set a target cost per conversion.Yes.My target CPA over here is going to be $275.We will talk in a lot more detail how to mathematically set your target CPA, how to think about a targetCPA cap, and some cases where you do not want a target CPA cap.But I'm going to put a target CPA cap for now.I'm going to leave the Google search partners included, but I'm going to exclude display network.Google tells me that I could use a display expansion to get more conversions at a similar cost per action,but I don't want to do it because I have enough experience to know.I have enough experience to know that I really want to just be on the Google search network and searchpartner network.I'm going to be targeting just the United States here.Your location options.You could enter another location, you could do an advanced search and do radius targeting.We'll talk more about that in more detail in another lecture.But for now I'm going to click the United States.My language is English.If you're advertising in a different language, select your language.Audience segments.This is a larger conversation.We've we have lectures specifically dedicated to audience segments.But I'm going to leave them blank for now because I'm going to show you how later you can go back andchange the audience segments and update the audience segments.Why?You might want to update audience segments in your campaign after you've configured it.Broad match keywords.Do we use broad match keywords for your entire campaign, or do we use keyword match types?So as I've told you in the past, in other lectures, Google is really moving people into broad match,and broad match does work and broad match should be embraced.However, for now, as my foundational search campaign, I want to retain control of my match types.I want to be able to use exact match and phrase match still and broad match modified until Google takesaway that ability.And do I want Google to automatically create my ad assets?Write my ad headlines for me?If you're really moving quickly and you are super pressed for time, you can toggle this option on,but I don't recommend you do it.Learn to create your own ad assets.It's always they're always going to outperform Google's, um, sort of AI driven headlines and imagery.We have some additional settings ad rotation optimized for for best performing ads.Yes.This is something that we changed over the years.We used to say, um, rotate ads indefinitely, and then we would choose which ads were the winners.But now the best performing campaigns allow Google to optimize for the best performing ads you could.You could set in advance a start and end date for a campaign.It's going to be by default today, and your end date will not will not be set, which means the campaignwill run recurring until you pause or turn off that campaign.You could set an ad schedule.We're not going to set this ad schedule now because it's something that you can do later.Typically, I'd also recommend not setting an ad schedule.We talked a lot about liquidity.We talked a lot about giving Google's machines the least amount of restrictions for them to reach yourgoals.So that's what you really want to do.You want to give them the least amount of restrictions for them to reach your goals.Um, and unless you're absolutely certain that you shouldn't have ads running overnight, or you shouldn'thave ads running on a certain day of the week or a certain time of day, let Google run your ads allday and Google's going to optimize.They're going to spend more money during hours and days that are showing the most results.And again, that goes back to making sure conversion tracking is properly configured.We can create campaign URL options tracking templates if you want to bring in certain UTM parameters.This is something that we would typically leave off in the beginning as well.And then we talked about brand lists.Positive brand lists and brand exclusion lists.This is a one area where you can add them, but you can also come back and add those lists later.Um, so with brand inclusions, your ads for this campaign will only show when the search matches thesearch for certain selected brands.This is something which will greatly limit search traffic, right?It will greatly limit search traffic.Brand exclusions are just saying I want to.If somebody is searching for this brand, I want to make sure that my ad does not show.This is a really awesome feature for ecommerce businesses in particular.Um, brand inclusions and both brand exclusions are really powerful ways to sculpt the type of trafficthat you're getting.It's a form of audience targeting.It's a form of giving Google that signal.But in this case, I don't have any specific brand inclusions or brand exclusions that I want to use,so I don't need
