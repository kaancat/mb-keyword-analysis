# 18.3 Requesting a Manual Review of Your Ads and Expediting the Process

How do you lads fans in welcome back.Really quick lecture here I want to show you how to ask for a manual review of your ads to get themapproved quicker.So you're going to go to this URL and I'm going to add this URL in the resources section, its supportdot google.com, forward slash Google ads for it slash contact forward slash approval under slash orunderscore request.This is the URL.You go here and you go here after you save, edited or new ads into your account because those ads willbe under review immediately.Come to this link.You're going to give your name, you're going to give your contact email, which is the email that youwant Google to respond to you with.You're going to give the login email address associated with the account and question your tangent,your ten digit customer ID and to get your customer ID, you just go back into your AdWords dashboard.And up here in the upper right hand corner is your ten digit customer ID.That's where it always lives.You're going to select a language of your own reviewed ads, the topic of the reviewed ads.So if it's just a regular account, you'll just click other.But if you are specifically in a sector that's listed here, then use that.What would you like to review?Could be ads, keyword extensions.Do please briefly describe your issue.I'll typically just say something.Hey, we put in some new some new ads for an important client.We'd it's pretty time sensitive.We'd really appreciate it or I'd really appreciate it if you could get a chance to approve these atthe top of the of your workload or your pipeline, whatever it is.Thanks so much.And again, you're talking to another person who's going to be reading this email and going into youraccount to approve the ads and then click submit.And that's that.Google will send you an email right away notifying you that your ads, that your request has been received.And then you'll see that the speed at which your ads get approved will go up dramatically.It's a really, really great tool.We use it all the time, so it's a great trick.It's a great resource.Again, use this link, use this website, save it as a bookmark on your browser and your browser.I have it saved.We come here all the time we sent to send these reviews, review requests.Again, if you're part of an agency or you have a multi client center that has many accounts, thenyou're going to be routed to a higher level support team and you'll get these things done faster.But still, even if it's you're just an individual running a smaller account, it's still very worthwhileto use this tool.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about some best practices when it comes to creating ads,and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon.I hope you have a good time using this little form that Google gives us here.So now.
