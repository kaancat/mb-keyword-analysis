# 17.1 Ad Group Structure Basics and Organization

How do Google ads fans and welcome back.Welcome to this exciting new section of the course where we're going to talk about ad groups and adgroup structure.We're not going to talk about all the different things we're going to cover eventually with ad groups.We're going to talk about all the fundamental components of ad group structure and what ad groups are.So we're on the screen back at the computer where Google brought us.Once we finished setting up all our campaign settings and we have a few different options, we couldchoose to have a standard or dynamic ad group.And because we're going to be more sophisticated advertisers controlling our profits more, we're goingto always be using standard ad groups, and we're going to be able to name our ad group, put in somekeywords, put in a default bid, get some keyword ideas from Google potentially, and lots of differentthings we do on this page.We're going to come back and set all that stuff up right after.But I want to talk about some ad group structure ideas, making sure we understand what ad groups do,how they work, and how we could use them to our advantage.So let's just go jump into some slides.So there are a couple of things I want to just talk about real quick when it comes to aggregate structure.So first of all, it's important to keep in mind your overall campaign structure ideas when structuringyour ad groups.We started off the course when we talked about campaign structure, how we're going to break out thiscampaign for Poppin, and that's the template example we're using.And then there's also whatever your business is going to be, how are you breaking out your campaignsand inside ad groups?Are your keywords and your ads.And all the ads inside an ad group could be shown for any of the keywords inside your ad group.The most important thing to begin thinking about is themes thematically related.Groups of keywords should be what goes inside an agreement.A really good way to make sure you do that is to follow the navigational structure of your website,which something that we've discussed.Remember that you can always change your ad group structure as you go along.In fact, that's something that you should anticipate doing some of the really good ideas that I'm goingto give you in the following slide for breaking out.If restructuring aid groups like it's there's there's a difference between how you would potentiallystructure aid groups in the research data and analysis phase of your campaigns and how you might structureyour ad groups afterwards.So remember that you could always change and you should be as you as you optimize your account, you'regoing to be constantly changing the structure of your ad groups by begin by thinking most about organization.The most important thing at the beginning of a campaign is being able to collect good data that willbe practical to you.You want to understand how is the search network performing?You understand how are these keywords performing?You want to understand how are these match types performing?You want to understand how are these ads at performing?How how is this ad copy performing all those different types of things?And you want to make sure that there's clean data in each actor.But when I say clean, I mean I don't mean to say that there should be one keyword in every ad groupthat's definitely not the case, but the type of information you're getting.So is this product category working?Perhaps a product category might be a good way to have different ad groups, but again, you could alsostructure out product categories at the campaign level.But is this subcategory working?And then I could drill into that ad group and I could see a manageable group of keywords where I canget a relatively cohesive snapshot on the performance of that micro section of my overall advertisingefforts.So beginning by thinking about organization, organization means something different to every companywe're going to talk about in the very next slide, what organization would look like for Poppin or for?And I'll show you some other examples as we go on through the course of active accounts and clients.But it's really important to think about that because organization is how you're going to understandyour data and that's how you're going to make your account better.Your account's not going to perform as well.It's going to as well as it could perform the first time you launch a new campaign, even if it's anaccount that has a lot of historic data, campaigns get better over time, and with good optimizationstrategies, your campaign performance will increase.But the only way you're going to be able to figure out what good optimization strategies are is if yourdata is clean between different ad groups.So think about that.So I have this picture on the right hand side of the screen.Again, this is where I'm going to get my ideas for organization for Poppins Office Chair campaign.We could have built we could have potentially built a furniture campaign and had office chairs as anad group or have a few different ad groups or office chairs.But I felt that this was a large enough navigational structure.It's a large enough industry.We're getting enough volume that it would be better to have a campaign for furniture and then buildthings out beneath that.But there are all sorts of different ways we could potentially structure this.So here's a layout of what I think a good overall account structure for Pop In might look like.And I'm actually going to go and build this entire thing out and probably even make it larger and moreinvolved to use to show you what a fully built out account might look like.It's not built out right now.This is a brand new account and we're sort of building this out as if we'd be building this out forPop.And if I was consulting with Pop and this is something that I might show them for a proposed accountstructure for the beginning, this is definitely not what what an overall account structure would looklike.So as you can see, we have a few different top level categories over here, right?We have furniture, we have office supplies, we have corporate branding and we have design services.Those are the top level categories, but they're not going to be used for campaigns because there wereso many subcategories and categories under the subcategories that we felt that we would want to buildout a little bit more of a nuanced account.So then we take a look at campaigns.We have our office desks campaign, which is what we're building out.We have a campaign for office chairs.We have a campaign for file cabinets under office supplies.We'll have a campaign for desk organization, wall organization, writing supplies, etc. Then we havea bunch of ad groups.So under office desks, following the basic navigational structure of the site, we have adjustableheight office desks as an ad group, benching desks, L-shaped desks, standing desks, and then a veryimportant ad group called General Desks.And the general desks are for terms where people are just searching for basically for office desks.They might not include something like adjustable or benching or L-shaped or standing desk.They might just know there's a large amount of people who just search for office desks.When we talk about keywords and we talk about the psychology of keywords and the buyers funnel or thebuyers funnel the buyer's journey, we'll talk about where these general keywords fit in and how wehandle them when it comes to bidding.But this is a potentially structured campaign for this office desk's top level category, which is underthe furniture canopy, although furniture is not a campaign and then an office chair so quickly, activeoffice chairs, reception chairs, stacking chairs, stools, general chairs.Now if you're getting a sense, you're, you're seeing two things.You're seeing themes and you're seeing organization, right?If I have an ad group that specifically is going to show ads for when people search for adjustable height,office desks, adjustable height desks, desks that can go up and down, different keywords like thatand different search terms like that.I could look at the data from the ad I and look at the clicks, the impressions, the click, the rate,the conversions, the conversion rate, the cost per conversion, the profitability, the return onad spend, the impression share, etc., etc. etc. And I can say like without drilling down to everyindividual keyword, I could say, okay, this sort of micro category is performing in this way.And if I'm getting a lot of volume, if I see that a certain ad group is getting a lot of volume, thenI could drill in and see.Are there performance variances between individual keywords inside that group?And that's something which is inevitable to happen, which is which is why it's good to have this organisationset up from the outset.You're going to see certain ad groups here and there's no way to there's no real way to predict thisup front.It's and I've done this enough times to know that there's no way to predict this.Even if you use a lot of the good research tools, certain ad groups will just start getting more volumeand they'll get a significant amount of more volume than the rest of the ad groups in the in the campaign.And certain campaigns will get significant more volume than the other campaigns in the account.When that happens, it's great because now I know, I know, I know what I direct my efforts if I have.And over here, this is just a small sampling of all the potential ad groups in a Google ads accountor poppin.But even if there is 50 different ad groups, I don't have the time or the energy and it doesn't evenmake sense to be optimizing with the same level of attention.Every single one of those ad groups.Equally, you want to put your attention towards the ad groups that are going to have the most whereyour optimizations will have the most financial impact on your business.So by finding the ad groups that are spending the most getting the most volume, then I'll be able todrill in to the keyword level and see, oh, this keywords really accounting for most of the performance,this keywords performing so poorly, it's bringing the average down.Why is it has a little quality score?Is it a bad keyword or is the wrong match type?Is it the wrong bidding strategy, etc., etc.?Where do I move it?Do I move these things out?That's when you can make good decisions.But having your ad groups super, super organized with thematically grouped lists of keywords, andwe'll talk about how to research themes and how to organize keyword lists and excel.And I have a couple of really cool tools for you that's all coming up in the keyword section of thiscourse.But here's this is sort of sort of some different structural ideas.So if we take a look at corporate branding over here, there weren't enough different subcategoriesto necessitate too many different campaigns with all the different ad groups.But here's a good potential structure.If I see that under corporate branding and I do some research and I know that there's a few differentthings that people are really searching for, right?Mugs, gifts, desk accessories, pens, products, and I mean, of course, taking into account withwhat we actually sell.But I also realized through my research that people typically use one of two terms promotional or custom,right?Sometimes people will search for custom desk accessories, sometimes people will search for promotionaldesk accessories.And to us as the vendor, they mean the same thing we have.We could fulfill both of those requests, although they're being searched for in different ways.People are using different language and there's a whole background to understanding the psychology ofsearch.And what are people really expressing when they use certain words?And do certain words indicate somebody being somebody else somewhere else in in the funnel?And that's that's true.Which is part of the reason why we would want to separate these out.It could be somebody searching for custom mugs, might be a smaller business or looking for somethingmore personal.Whereas somebody looking for promotional mugs, that's a term that's more used for larger businessesor for business or high quantity orders of a product.So I might be willing to bid higher because promotional mugs and promotional gifts and those searchterms are going to generate higher returns.And I want to be able to control that by bidding at the aggregate level for custom mugs.I might know from my historic data that it's going to be a mix.Sometimes people are looking for just a couple mugs or just a couple products that they want to do somethingfor a birthday or anniversary.They might search for custom, and then I'd be willing to pay less per click, and I could do that bysegmenting it out of the aggregate level.One of the reasons why I would have separate campaigns is also for the sake of organization.I could, let's say, label these two campaigns.We'll talk about campaign labels and when to use them.We could label these two campaigns separately or under corporate branding as a category, and I couldtake a look quickly at the campaign level.Is my promotional campaign doing better or is my custom campaign doing better?And then I could again, I could see where do I want to direct my effort.So really all thinking about organization quickly looking at this design services category, I reallywould only have one campaign because if we look at design services, design services is really one primarypage.So I would start splitting things out by top of funnel, middle of funnel, bottom, bottom of funnel,but also splitting it out by match type.So we haven't talked about match types yet.That's going to be quite a bit of time.But over here, M stands for exact match, P stands for phrase match, beam stands for a broad matchand also potentially broad match modified.I usually call that beam t f stands for top of funnel F stands for middle of funnel bow stands for bottomof funnel.And we'll talk about those terminologies a lot throughout the course and we'll talk about those differentterminologies a lot throughout the course.Those acronyms, top of funnel refers to a person who is at the earlier stages of the buyers funnel.Middle of funnel refers to people who are in the process of evaluating different options.They've decided they want to buy something.Bottom of the funnel is there really right before that final purchase decision and they're making thatfinal decision what what they're going to actually purchase.They're expressing people express different terms through different areas of through how they searchGoogle.They could you could sometimes glean what where they are in the funnel.And again, we'll talk more about that in detail by the keywords.But I know just at a very high level, conceptually top a funnel search terms typically will convertless, it'll take longer to convert.But also the clicks are typically cheaper because the user is not expressing as much commercial intentin their search, which therefore is not as valuable to other other advertisers.My competitors, which therefore means they're not bidding as much, which therefore means the clickwill cost less, which therefore means it's probably still a good click to buy if I can.So I would segment them out because I could then at the ad group level control, maybe I want a bitdifferently, maybe at bottom of funnel, I want to bid on the CPA basis, but on the top of the funnelcampaigns, because I'm not getting enough conversions, I want to bid on the CPC basis so I could usethose different adverb structure to control how I actually bid and what my bidding strategy might be.And that's another good example of using an organizational method to structure your ad groups.So now you have an understanding of sort of what ad groups are.I highly recommend drafting out something like what you're seeing here for your own campaigns.You could do it with a paper and pen.That's how I used to do it.I usually use now something like Google Diagram, which helps me easily just move boxes around and draftout what my campaigns will look like, what my aggregates will look like.I'll put in some example keywords.Like I really, really think it's really helpful just to, to, to sketch out what your campaigns willlook like because once you then collaborate with your team as you're writing it out, you always getnew ideas of, Maybe I should put this ad up here, maybe I should structure this campaign differentlybased on math type.Or maybe I should do it this way based on product category, all these different sorts of things.So drafting it out really, really helps it.Highly recommend you do that as a quick exercise.What I would encourage you doing is taking a pen and paper go into Google diagram and drafting out foryour business what an ideal structure would look like.And again, think about thematically related groups of keywords and think about this idea of organization.Think about the concept of how important it is to get clean data at the very beginning of your campaigns.And I think you'll do a really good job coming up with some different cool ad structural ideas.That's it for this lecture.I very much look forward to seeing you in the very next lecture.
