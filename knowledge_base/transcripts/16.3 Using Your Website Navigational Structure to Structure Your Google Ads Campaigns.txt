# 16.3 Using Your Website Navigational Structure to Structure Your Google Ads Campaigns

How to Google Ads fans.And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about how to use your website's navigational structure to startthinking about how you want to build out your Google ads campaign structure.Remember, in the last lecture, we spoke about the differences between campaigns and accounts and adgroups, and it's important that certain types of things are going to be segmented out at the campaignlevel.Here we are at CNN.com.This is a website which we'll use as a template.And imagine where we're building out a campaign, a Google ad search campaign for poppin and we don'tknow where to start.They sell lots of different types of office furniture and supplies and different categories and allsorts of things.And we want to figure out how to separate out our campaigns.So let's go over and take a look at how they look at their navigation.So I'm going to hover over furniture, so I see different categories.There's desks and benching adjustable height desks, office chairs, stools, so on and so forth.Under office supplies.I see the same thing desk organization, notebooks, planners, corporate branding, design services,all sorts of things that we want to do.Now, the first thing to realize is that you're not always going to start off advertising all your servicesand all your products.This is a mistake.I see lots and lots of people making.It's unlikely that every single product in every single product category and every single service thatyou offer is going to be able to be advertised profitably on Google ads.Sometimes the clicks will be too expensive and sometimes the conversion rates will just be too low.So you want to start off thinking about the core group of services that either your best sellers, theyare the most important services.They're the services that you have the highest margins on.And start with that group of products, product categories or services.You could also consider loss leaders, lost leaders, or when you have a certain product that mightnot be profitable, but you're willing to either break even or take a little bit of a loss because youknow that this service ends up generating sales for a follow up service or a certain product or a certainproduct category like desk accessories.If they're bought, they might not generate profit on that first initial sale.But you know from your own data that typically those people will come by, come back and buy more lateron.So that's something very worthwhile to think about as well, loss leaders.And you have to build that into your lifetime value of your customer calculations and we'll get to that,of course, in a future lecture.But in this case, there's two different ways that are obvious to me that you could start off buildingout these campaigns.One is I could have my campaign set up at the top level categories of this navigation so I can havea campaign for furniture, a campaign for office supplies, a campaign for corporate branding, anda campaign for design services.My ad groups would then potentially be the subcategories of that primary navigation, so I'd have anunder my furniture campaign, I might have a an ad group for desks and benching and ad for adjustableheight desks.And if I click into adjustable height desks in my ad group, I'll see that I have these products andthese product pages.You want to also think about what page you want to send that traffic to.So you don't want to be too broad and you also don't want to be too specific.So if I have adjustable height desks and somebody's searching for adjustable height desks, standingdesk so far and so on and so forth, I think that this would be this page that we're on now, I thinkwould be a good place to send that traffic to.You could even drill further down.So I see benching under adjustable height desks in this navigation.I see benching desks, desk risers like L-shaped desks and single desks.So there's all sorts of different products.Now, if I go and I do some research and I see that there's a lot of people who search specificallyfor single desks, a lot of people who search specifically for L-shaped standing desks.Right.And I want to have really hyper specific adverbs, which is not a bad idea in this case.I don't necessarily think I would do it that way.I think I would just send it I would just have an ad for adjustable height desks, but I could potentiallyturn any of these subcategories into campaigns as well.So I might have a campaign for desks and benching, or rather, let's say in the previous example,I might have a campaign for adjustable height desks and then have an ad group for benching desks, deskrisers, L-shaped desks and single desks.The point is that I'm using my navigational structure on my website to inform my decisions about howI want to bring out my campaigns and Google ads.And it makes a lot of sense.Not only is it just a place to get good ideas, your navigation is usually structured well.It is structured in a way that there are pages, there's information structured in a certain way.Hiring navigation is structured is also how your information is structured.How your information is structured is how you're going to get landing pages for your ads.What what area of your site, what page on your site are you going to be sending traffic to?So I want to make sure that I'm able to be specific enough that if somebody searches for something specific,I can send them to the right area of my site.That's obviously going to increase the usefulness of the information you provide those customers andyou're going to have a higher conversion rate.That's just basic common sense.So again, there's two ways I would potentially break it out up here.I would have a top level campaign for furniture with ad groups below, ad groups or file cabinets,ad groups or tables, ad groups for long seating, so on and so forth.I might have an ad, I might have a campaign for corporate branding and then an ad group for brandedsets, notebooks, pens, desktop organization, new arrivals.But again, it's tricky because let's say what to click in depends.There's ballpoint pens, there's gel ink, there's rollerball.So let's say somebody searching for Rollerball, branded pens or so on and so forth.This gets into a big argument that a lot of people have, and I'm happy to sort of settle it right nowabout how specific a page you want to send traffic to.So here's a good example that we just landed on with pens.Say somebody searches for corporate pens or corporate ballpoint pens.I could send them to this page that we're on now that just shows all pens, and then they would haveto filter themselves into ballpoint.Or I could literally click ballpoint and take this URL and then I can have an ad group for ballpointcorporate pens.I think it would be a big mistake to drill down to this level of specificity.There's a concept in photography, and if you're any of you are professional photographers, don't holdme totally accountable for understanding this concept fully.Or maybe I'm making a little bit of a stretch or a bad application.But this concept called closure people a photograph.Shouldn't give all the information about the scene.There should be a little bit left for the user to work or the viewer rather to work to figure out whatis all what's really the peripheral information contained in this in this shot.And it's a very powerful concept because that closure and having enough information where I don't needto work too hard to understand what's going on in the scene, but not having all the information wheremy brain on my own could fill in the missing pieces.It gives a person a sense of ownership of of his perception.People are the same way when they're shopping for products.If I'm searching for something, I want to be able to find it myself.I don't want to have to be drudging through a poorly designed site or a suboptimal layout.That's painful, and that's going to alienate your visitors.It's going to decrease your conversion rate.But to an extent, you don't need to be totally hyper specific.So if I'm looking for gel ink, corporate branded pens, you don't need to send me to a page that justhas a gel ink corporate branded pen on it.You can send me to a page that talks about your branded pens, and then I could be more than happy toeasily look at the conventional filter and click gel ink.In fact, I feel better about that.That's a very deep psychological, psychological concept at play called closure, where I'm actuallydeciding what I want.Meaning it's like going to a restaurant and the waiter bringing you just one specific thing I like.I like to look at a menu of things.I like to choose my own item.I like to evaluate my options and then decide even if even if I did search, you might say that's nota good example, because in the case of the waiter, how should the waiter know what you want?In this case, you specifically ask for gel rollerball branded pens, but yet still users on the internetand users on websites.And this is something which has been researched over and over again when companies send users to thesevery minimal landing pages that have very little information and very little content.Users will typically go and try to find the homepage and then navigate their way down to the productor service or information that they're looking for.And that's something which is it's a really strong case against the overuse of individual landing pages.And I am a big I totally encourage standalone landing pages for PPC campaigns or whatever the campaignmight be in certain cases and done right.And as long as you're giving enough information, but if you're too thin, then then you're not allowingthe user to make his own decision to evaluate his own buying decision buying choice.And that's something you don't want to take away from the user.So I went on a tangent there for a little bit, but what I'm saying is that I think that the campaignstructure here, it would be appropriate to have, let's say, corporate branding at the top as a campaignand then just pens as an ad group.And users can then find whether they want gel, ink, ballpoint or rollerball pens themselves.That's exactly how it structured.So you see over here and we don't need to go through every single example, but using the way your informationis structured and the architecture of your website as a way to inform your campaigns, it's a really,really good idea.Now, for example, let's say Poppin only sells file cabinets on the West Coast for whatever reason.So then you'd have to have a separate campaign for file cabinets because you'd only want to show adson the West Coast, and this is in the United States, and this could apply for any location.But and let's say they sold all their other the the example would only work providing that they soldall the other furniture categories across the whole country or the world.So then you would have two separate campaigns because of that.And we spoke about that in the previous lecture that sometimes you're compelled from a technical perspectiveto have campaigns broken out in a certain way because you only have certain campaign settings that you'reallowed.There are only there are certain settings that are only control that the campaign level.So sometimes you're compelled that way.But most of the time when you're building out campaigns, you're doing it for organization, you'redoing it so you could send users to the right page.You're doing it so you could organize your own data.That's an example for Pop.And let's take a look quickly.Here's a client of ours, Cara's negotiating seminar.In fact, I just had a meeting here in House at Adventure Media with this client this morning.Incredible, incredible client.And this is a different company.They sell negotiating seminar registrations.And let's go ahead and see if we could figure out a potential search campaign structure for the accountfrom their navigation.So at the very top, I see that there's seminars.I see train your team.Is a different type of seminar.There's a customized in-house program, block seat program, testimonials who attends and then finda seminar.Oh, interesting.There's seminars in different locations, right?So I could potentially have a campaign that talks about all negotiating seminars from any location.So anytime somebody searches for a negotiating seminar or whatever, I could show an ad.But what might be even better is if I break it out by state.So potentially, if they have seminars in 50 states, they don't, but they have seminars in around30 states but about 100 different cities around the world.So I might have 100 campaigns each campaign targeting that city that the seminar is in.And I'll be able to customize, write two things.I'll be able to customize the add text.I'll be able to say that instead of just get more information on negotiating seminars, get more informationon negotiating seminars in Portland, the best selling negotiating seminar in Baltimore, the best sellingnegotiating seminar in Guadalajara, whatever it is.Right.And send them to the right page that talks about the negotiating seminar in that location.So if I was dealing with a Portland campaign, I might have different ad groups targeting differentthemes of keywords all around negotiating seminars or that business seminars or training or negotiatingclasses, right?I might do set up separate set up my ad groups that way, but at the top level, because I see valuein splitting it up by campaign, that would be potentially how I would structure an account like thisfor for search campaigns.Now, you might be wondering, and rightfully so.Well, if you structured only by those hundred cities, what about the rest of the world that is searchingfor negotiating seminar and willing to travel to a city?They're not going to be able to see an ad if they search for negotiating seminars.Well, I would also have a separate search campaign that might be world wide.It might have more conservative bids.Right.Remember that another advantage of segmenting out campaigns in aggregates is that I could bid differently.And it's true.Bidding or the amount you're willing to bid is not necessarily a technically compelling reason for whyyou would have campaigns set up broken out, because you could control bids at the keyword and aggregatelevel as well.But it might just be easier and simple to manage a large account if I want to bid more aggressively.When people are searching for negotiating seminar and they're in the city where I offer a negotiatingseminar and I might want to bid less aggressively in a world wide campaign for anybody searching fornegotiating seminar, I might be willing to pay less for a click because that user is less valuable.Why?Because that person is less likely to travel to a different city to go to to to go to a negotiatingseminar than a person inside or inside a city that's looking for a negotiating seminar.And we offer one right in their backyard.So that's again, another example how we would use a a navigational structure and how the informationis laid out on my website to start getting good ideas for campaign structure.Inside Google ads, let's take briefly another look at another client, the International Culinary Centerclient of ours.Again, really fun, incredible client, really dynamic campaigns, exciting stuff, challenging, challengingaccount.But we see here right away, I get some ideas for how I would structure out a Google ads account.They have a New York campus, they have a California campus.But wow, look at so many different things.They have.They have a New York campus and they have professional culinary arts, professional pastry and baking,professional wine, continuing continuing education, all different sorts of all different sorts ofclasses and courses that they offer.They offer an under continuing education.They have all these different culinary entrepreneurship, food styling for media, right?There's tons of programs.What we've actually done is built out quite a monstrous account where we have lots of search campaignsthat are structured for New York, lots of search campaigns that are structured for California, notjust one, but even within New York.In California, we have inside Manhattan, right?Right around Soho, which is where their main flagship campus is.We have bids more aggressive then expanding out radius targeting to the tri state area, bids a littlebit less aggressive then East Coast World, East Coast, nationwide, even less aggressive than thatand separate campaigns within those location tiers for all the different programs.Now you also have to recognize that certain programs represent different levels of value to the clientand certain services.And if you're in a service business or you're in a product business, you have the same thing.Every product you offer, every service you offer will have different levels of value to you, whetherit regards, whether it's your profit margin is higher or lower or some other factor.You could also build out campaigns based on the value and the aggressiveness you want to bid for a specificproduct or service.And that's something that we've done for this account as well.The more expensive programs that generate more revenue for the client, we have in separate campaignsand they're sort of they're sort of it's sort of a little bit like an algorithm.The closer you are to the campus, you have an aggressive, more aggressive bid and the higher revenuegenerating program you're searching for, the more aggressive the bid.So a searcher that's closest to the flagship location will have a very high bid, but even a higherbid if that person is also searching for a program that generates a large amount of revenue for theclient.So it's a really cool system.And again, it's following the basic structure and hierarchy of how the information is laid out on thesite.One more quick example.Sundance, now owned by AMC Television Networks, a streaming service that sort of competes with Netflix.It's much smaller.It doesn't really compete head to head.This is more independent, more cerebral films, documentaries, a lot of original content.Let's take a look at their navigation or click and see what ideas we get.Well, we see films, we see documentaries, series, collections.Well, all of a sudden we're able to start getting a sense of how we want to break out our campaign.So we have a campaign for films, and within films we have different sorts of campaigns, campaignsthat and this is something we'll call a top of funnel, middle of funnel, bottom of the funnel.So bottom of the funnel might be people looking for specific titles, right?Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro, Stream Taxi Driver.We'll be able to send them to a very specific page, but let's say somebody is just looking for independentmovies or independent films.More top of the funnel, less likely to buy from us today, less likely to sign up for a subscriptiontoday.But still we want to bid.When I could separate those out into their own campaign.Into a separate campaign, then I'll be able to adjust my bids or just the location targeting, adjustthe aggressiveness of other settings, and I'll be able to then log in to Google ads, download a reportof the campaigns, or open up a campaign report inside Google ads and get that information in such anorganized, efficient way.And that's what I really want to impress upon you.It's so important that your that your data is clean.You don't want to have that much overlap between campaigns.You want to know that this campaign is the data from this campaign is telling me this about my productsand services.The data from this campaign is telling me this is the amount of clicks, this is the amount impressions,this is the click through rate, this is the cost per conversion, this is the volume of conversions.This is the return on the ad spend for this product or service in this location or whatever it may be.However, you've decided to bring it out.That's the main thing.Make sure you break it out in a way that is organized.And again, if you jump into the Facebook group, you'll get and this is one of the hardest things andone of the most overwhelming things about Google ads, figuring out how to structure an account.I deal with this every single day.We have lots of clients.I've managed hundreds of campaigns.I've built hundreds of accounts.And I'm not saying this to brag.I'm just saying that I've recognized that this is one of the hardest things because there's so manydifferent ways to do it.There's no right or wrong way to do it.And once you start learning about keywords and match types, then you have a whole new way of potentiallystructuring your ad groups and then your ad groups are within your campaigns.And how do you account for overlap and how do you use ad group level negative keywords and campaignlevel negative keywords and negative keyword lists?It gets overwhelming.So I would definitely suggest learn the basics, start off with your navigational structure on yourwebsite, but also use the Facebook group, speak to other students, throw out your different ideasand you'll get the more people collaborating, the more ideas you bounce off other people.Not a day goes by that I don't go out of my office and I pull over one of our team members or eightor ten of our team members.And I say, Listen, I'm trying to build this account.Let's just have a roundtable discussion about what the best ideas are, and you might not have the opportunityto do that, but the Facebook group and the support group of Forgey that opportunity.So just briefly, to review your navigational structure, your information architecture on your websiteis a good place to start.Now, if your navigational structure and your information architecture on the website is not good andyou should check out my course on landing page design.Shameless plug over there if you want to improve the navigational structure in the information architectureon your website.But if it is good and and it's useful, that's a great place.It's the best place to start to get a sense of how you should build out your campaign, how you shouldbuild out your Google ads account.And now that you have now that you have an understanding of the hierarchy of a Google ads account,you understand the different concepts of of campaign structure and how to go to your website and startjust getting quick ideas through the navigation.You're in a good place to choose what you want your first campaign to be.And now that you have a good understanding of a Google Ads account hierarchy, you understand how togo to your website, take a look at your information architecture, and apply that to a strategy forbuilding out campaigns.You're in a very good place to pick a campaign for your very first campaign that we're building now.And in the next lecture, we're going to go ahead and do that.We're going to choose from Pop and what our first campaign is going to be.We're going to go and start building that campaign, going through each setting, and we're going tolearn a ton.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon.I hope so far things are useful and you're starting getting a really clear fundamental sense of Googleads.I know this is not advanced stuff, but you have no idea how valuable understanding the fundamentalsare in being able to build on the more advanced topics as you go along.Trust me, just bear with me.Give me some faith.I guarantee you you'll be very, very happy and pleased that you you stuck with it through some of themaybe the more boring stuff, but hopefully we're keeping this very, very interesting as we go along.I will see you guys very shortly in the very next lecture.
