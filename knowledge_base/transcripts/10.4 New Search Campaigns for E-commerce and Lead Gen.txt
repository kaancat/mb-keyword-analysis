# 10.4 New Search Campaigns for E-commerce and Lead Gen

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about creating new search campaigns for e-commerce businesses versuslead gen businesses.So at a high level, you know you typically have a breakdown in campaign strategy based on these twobuckets.Are you selling stuff off your website or are you generating leads from your website?So if you're an agency or you're a local service business or you're a travel agent, those are leadgen businesses.If phone calls or form submissions are important to you, those leads coming into your CRM, you'rea lead gen business.If you have a shopping cart and a checkout page, whether you're selling digital goods or you're sellingphysical goods, you're an e-commerce business so that you know that categorization is going to havea very large impact.Probably the largest impact on the campaign types, the strategy, the account setup, the settings,audience targeting and so on.So we're going to walk through sort of like high level tips and what to think about when you're settingup these different types of campaigns.And then we're going to actually go do a a fresh campaign setup walkthrough for a lead gen business.So you're a brand new.We're building a brand new search campaign, launching bidding strategies for an e-commerce campaign,and of course, with accurate conversion tracking data.So how do you begin with all these different settings that we've talked about and strategies?So for bidding strategies begin with maximize conversion value.That bidding strategy allows Google to learn and optimize best.Then you're going to go through the two week learning phase.But you should run this for 3 to 4 weeks for better benchmarks.So you begin by having your shopping feed.We're going to talk about shopping feeds and Google Merchant Center.Um, pmax all of the all of the goods.But what about bidding strategy?You have your manual CPC, you can bid on target Roas, target CPA, but it's a fresh campaign.It's a fresh e-commerce campaign.Use maximize conversions and run that for 3 to 4 weeks.Then after 3 to 4 weeks, switch off of maximize conversion value and go to a target Roas strategy.So target Roas is now telling Google I don't want you to just maximize conversion value, ignoring howmuch money I'm spending on ads.I actually want there to be a relationship between how much I'm spending on ads and how much money I'mmaking that's targeted Roas.So if it's a 200% target Roas or a 300% target Roas, and I want to generate $3 in advertising for everydollar I spend, I want to generate $3 in revenue for every dollar I spent on advertising.That would be a 300% Roas.I'm going to switch to max to.I'm going to switch to target Roas.After 3 to 4 weeks of maximized conversion value, you have the option of running a 50 over 50 experimentsplit for gradual transition.So if you feel that you maximize if the maximized conversion value campaign is doing really well andperformance is really good and there is a good Roas, then you can either leave it running as maximizedconversion value, or you could run a 50 over 50 experiment.So you would you would go into that campaign, create a campaign experiment, and the experiment wouldbe the bid strategy.So you would have 50% of the traffic running to the maximized conversion value version of this campaign.And you would have 50% of the traffic running to the target return on ad spend target Roas version ofthat campaign.That's the structure.That's the concept of Google ads campaign experiments.Now, after your initial two weeks, what do you do?You got to review search terms and your trends.So understanding what what what people are searching on Google, looking through the actual search terms,adding negative keywords and adjusting your ad copy and campaign structure based on quality score andauction insights.You're going to look at Auction Insights report.Which competitors are you overlapping with?Which competitors that should you be overlapping with and maybe you're not overlapping with?That's going to allow you to adjust your keyword strategy, adjust your negative keyword strategy,potentially segment out your ad groups into a few more ad groups, or potentially take an overly segmentedapproach and create a more condensed account structure approach with fewer ad groups and fewer campaigns.You're also, after two weeks, going to look at your quality scores.You're going to open up your keywords inside any individual ad group or all the keywords in a campaign.And you're going to open up the quality score column and you're going to look, do I have keywords thathave a really poor quality score?If I have quality scores in the one, two, three range, I might want to either pause those keywordsif they're performing really poorly or if these are good keywords.I know that these are good keywords for my account and they still have a really bad quality score.I'm going to either I'm going to do one of two things.I'm going to rewrite my ads.I'm going to investigate my landing page to make sure I have enough content on that landing page thatis relevant to the queries in that ad group, or I'm going to take those keywords that have a reallypoor quality score, and I'm going to put them into their own ad group or into their own campaign,and write fresh ads specifically for those search terms and keywords.And I'm going to send those keywords to the best possible landing page that I have, and I'm going towait another two weeks to see if I have improved my quality score.Say you're building a brand new search campaign for a lead gen business.We're going to start with Maximize Conversions.Whereas on e-commerce, we started with maximized conversion value because I'm generating revenue forevery conversion.And Google is able to get that information with accurate conversion tracking data.Over here I'm going to start with maximize conversions.Of course we need to have set up conversion tracking.But we're going to start with maximize conversions.This is going to allow Google to learn and optimize through that two week learning phase.But again we're going to run maximize conversions for 3 to 4 weeks for better benchmarks.Then instead of switching to target return on ad spend where there's that direct linear relationshipbetween revenue and cost, I'm going to switch to target CPA After 3 to 4 weeks of running maximizeconversions.We're going to switch to a target CPA because Google is not getting typically with lead gen as as frequentof actual revenue reporting, because sometimes the sales cycle in the lead gen business is a littlebit long.However, the manager, you, the manager, the client must know and must be able to benchmark and understandthe value of a lead.So the value of the lead is going to give you your baseline CPA.So if my if the value in a lead, if I'm willing to pay $500 for a lead or $100 for a lead, that'smy target CPA.And again, you have the option to run as a 50 over 50 experiment split for a gradual transition afterthose initial two weeks.Exact same structure.You're going to look at search terms.You're going to look at trends.You're going to act.You're going to adjust and modify and make sure you're running a good negative keyword strategy.Adjust your ad copy and campaign structure based on quality scores and auction insights.Now, you can use value based bidding in lead gen campaigns.So if we are sending revenue information back into Google, where we've told Google that the value ofthis conversion, the value of this lead is X amount of dollars, then we can begin with maximized conversionvalue if we have that reliable value data.You don't want to be putting a $1 or $2 value for every form submission, if it's just arbitrary, andthen using value based bidding.But if you really understand that the value of a form submission is, um, the value of a form submissionis whatever it is, $80, then I'm applying that $80 value at the time I'm setting up my conversiontracking.Then I can begin with maximize conversion value.Otherwise use maximize conversions.Which which is telling Google to get me the highest volume of conversions first to establish those benchmarks.And then you could switch to value based bidding.When we talk about closing the feedback loop, we mean are we giving Google All the information anddata it needs to optimize for us.So here are the steps you need to think about and understand if you want to effectively close that feedbackloop.Aligning the campaign and the business performance.So oftentimes we see a huge mismatch between what Google is reporting and what the business is actuallyreporting.This could be that this might mean that Google is double counting conversions.This might mean that Google is not pulling revenue data incorrectly.Oftentimes it looks like you had a great day in Google.But in fact you look at the bank.You look at the the CRM sales results.And it's not it's not telling the same story.So the first step is diagnosing where the big issues lie.If you're 5% off or even 10% off, that's very normal because Google might miss some data.Not every click is going to load.Every browser is different, no matter how no matter how neurotic you become about this, you're likelygoing to see a difference between revenue clicks from Google and analytics in your CRM.There's going to be differences, but if you're within 5 to 10%, I think you're in the safe zone.If you're beyond that, you need to make sure that what you're seeing in Google ads and the informationthat Google is seeing aligns within that 10% margin of error with what is actually happening in thebusiness.Always be investigating if Google Ads is meeting targets, and that also means that you need to havetargets.When you launch a campaign, it's not enough to just give it a target CPA.That's what you're telling Google to use to optimize its day to day performance.But what are your targets for a campaign?Do you want to be able to increase budgets in two weeks?That's a target.Do you want to see a certain return on ad spend at a certain level of spend?That's a target.Do you want to sell a certain amount of products?That's a target.Do you want to get a certain amount of newsletter signups?That's a target, and assess if those metrics are really reflecting success.So as you're enhancing and you're optimizing and you're running your Google Ads campaigns, make surethat your business data in your CRM, your bank feeds, whatever systems you're using are telling thatsame basic story.And finally, close that feedback loop.Give Google as much information as you possibly can.And you want to give Google that information on business performance.And for lead gen, focus on lead quality, not just quantity.For example, a very common configuration, but something that a lot of advertisers don't do is trackingthe quality of a lead in your CRM.So whether it's HubSpot or Salesforce, Zoho or whatever system you're using or a Google Sheet, insteadof just saying, okay, I got 40 leads this month, well, how many high quality leads did you get thismonth?How many mqls did you get this month?How many sqls did you get this month and send that information back to Google?We're going to talk about more advanced ways of conversion tracking and how to set that up.But for now, it's important to understand that you can do that and you should do that.Use value rules to adjust lead customer value based on quality.So for example, if a certain checkbox or a certain input is is used in the CRM, and that was a leadthat had initially come through Google, you could send information back to Google to adjust to upgradeor downgrade the value of that lead based on what you find out about that lead in the sales process.You could use value based bidding then to assign values to leads.So if I'm using, um, total uh, maximize conversion value as a, as a strategy or I'm using targetRoas as a strategy, the more I could tell Google about the quality of certain types of leads, themore Google could learn that if I generate this type of lead, that is more likely to go further inthe sales cycle or become a client, then I'm willing to bid more in the auction.So remember everything about automated bidding.Everything about smart bidding is getting to a more accurate, real time auction on your behalf at thetime of the search.That's what it's about, whether to bid this much or that much.That's what all of this smart bidding is, is getting, is going towards.That's what it wants to do.So the more information you could tell Google about the revenue that you're generating from these differentleads, Google will begin to start building what we call behavioral paradigms, understanding that,oh, people in this location at this time of day, with this type of career, with this type of householdincome, with these types of attributes, with this type of YouTube channel history, right, so onand so forth, all those thousands of signals, those are the people who seem to be more likely to movefurther into your sales pipeline.So we're going to bid more aggressively for those.But if Google doesn't have that information, if you're just showing Google that all leads are createdequal, then Google is going to continue to treat any lead that at least just completes a form as equal.And lastly, offline conversion tracking, especially if you have a brick and mortar store and peopleare able to discover you online and then come into a store, um, and and check out you want to be ableto attribute that foot traffic back to Google and you can through offline conversion tracking, whichagain, we will discuss in more detail how that is set up and how to configure it for e-commerce.You want to optimize typically for margin, not just total revenue.So whereas maximized conversion value is how you start with e-commerce, eventually you want to havethat relationship between revenue and cost, and that's your margin.Work with a developer to track and optimize for profit margin.Typically you're going to have a catalog.In e-commerce, you're gonna have a catalog of products, and not every product is going to have thesame profit margin.If every product does have the same profit margin, then you're safe because you could just use a standardreturn on ad spend metric.However, if your profit margins across these different products are different, then just pulling inthe revenue from a product is not telling the whole story.If you have a $100 product with a $50 cost of goods sold, and you have $110 product with a $30 costof goods sold, Google is going to see $100 versus $110 in value, and they're going to use that metricto assess the relationship between cost and value.However, you're talking about a much more drastic difference in actual profit.So profit based bidding, which will allow you to send not only the revenue but the actual profit oneach product back into Google is a very effective way of powering up the feedback loop for e-commercecampaigns.Once you have profit based bidding, you could adjust campaign structure to push more high value productsand services.So if I want Google to spend more money and allocate more of my budget towards more of my higher valueproducts and my higher value services or the products that have higher margins, I could do that byputting products and product categories in specific campaigns, and giving those campaigns dedicatedbudgets, and using the correct automated bid strategy to reach that goal.Here's a sample timeline that's that's worth following along with.as a general checklist.Again, there's no hard and fast rules here, but this is a really great template that's worth thinkingabout or following along with as you launch a brand new search campaign.And again, the caveat here is assuming you have conversion tracking configured set up and it is accurate.So right away you have your campaign launch week one.You want to focus on analyzing search terms and adding negative keywords.That's your main that's your main um responsibility in week one.Week two you continue to analyze search terms and negative keywords.But now in week two, you can begin adjusting ad copy based on ad relevance scores.You want to see the ad relevance score inside Google and inside the ads report.You might be looking at quality score inside the search terms report.And now you can think about writing new ads.Number three, week three.You guessed it.We're analyzing search terms again.We're adjusting our negative keyword strategy.We're adjusting ad copy again.But now we might be pausing keywords.We might be putting keywords into their own um, uh, ad group.We might be adding exact match versions of keywords.We might be removing exact match versions of keywords and turning them into broad match keywords.We might be slightly adjusting our ad schedule.We might be slightly adjusting, um, audience signals.Week four.This is when we establish benchmarks.Okay.We want to say, where do we think we were going to be in week one?Where are we now?And now that we have a basic sense of what these clicks are costing, our impression volumes, our clickthrough rates, now we have benchmarks.We have a 2% conversion rate.That is our benchmark.We have a 2% click through rate, a 3% conversion rate, whatever it may be.Those are our benchmarks.Where do we want to get to in the next six months?What would be success in optimization over the next 3 to 6 months?Okay, so you establish those benchmarks in week four.You could you could begin shifting your bid strategies based on performance.This is shifting a bit.Strategy is a major shift in Google Ads and the Google Ads ecosystem.Changing bid strategy from annual CPC to target CPA or from target CPA to maximize conversion value.That's considered a major change and do it based on performance.Like we said earlier, if you're running a campaign on maximize conversion value and it's going reallywell, yes, it's true that bid strategy doesn't itself take cost into account.But who cares if your cost relationship between your conversion value, your revenue and profit is strongin your earning that margin that you'd like to earn at a minimum, then you likely should keep thatcampaign going with that same bid strategy.After week four, you've made a bunch of changes.You've written some new ads, you have good negative keywords.Now you calm down, let things sit for another two weeks, and then after that two week period, youcould continue on with a B testing, conversion rate, optimization opportunities on your landing pages,adjusting match types, adjusting the Roas or CPA cap adjustment.So if I have a campaign that's asking for asking Google for a 300% Roas and I'm not able to spend mydaily budget, it's not scaling.I might consider, can I lower my Roas target to 250%?The same thing with CPA in the other direction.If my CPA is $30, can I tell Google I'm willing to pay $40 for a conversion?And of course, I'm looking at the Auction Insights and Analysis report.I want to get a really good, clear sense of who in the auction, who in the competitive landscape I'mcompeting with in the auction.Now I'm going to share my screen and walk through an example search campaign setup.We're not going to go into tremendous detail here.I want to walk you through just how to do this in the Google Ads dashboard.So this is a middle grade novel that I wrote that I'm coming out with in a few months.Um, and I certainly hope you'll all buy a copy.But anyway, this is a pre-order page on Georgie somers.com forward slash pre-order.Uh, the book's title is Georgie Somers and the Scribes of Scatter.Plot.Shameless plug.It's an awesome, um, middle grade adventure fantasy perfect for kids between 10 and 1314 years old.Um, and it's it's being published by by a fantastic publisher.It's going to be in bookstores and available on Amazon, hopefully in December 2024.So anyway, here's a pre-order page that I'm going to start sending some marketing to.And there's going to be Google.There's going to be Amazon, there's going to be email campaigns.But here's a form submission.Okay.So we're just going to use this as an example as I build out the sort of the rough structure of whata search campaign might look like.So the headline of the page is join the waitlist.And then there's a simple get on the waitlist form your name, your email submit.Okay.So this is the action I want people to take.This is my conversion action.Now we could do some very rough back of the napkin math to figure out what my benchmark CPA for an emailmight be.Okay, so let's say for example, the books retail price is $20.Okay.So I'm going to end up coming after Amazon discounts it and and all of that jazz.So I'm going to roughly I'm going to come out with roughly $7 In profit.Okay.I'm sorry.$7 in revenue.So that's $7 in revenue.It's costing the publisher probably $2 to print, which is going to bring me bring bring Isaac's royaltyper copy, sold to $5.Okay.So I'm going to earn $5 of actual profit because I have a $2 cost of goods sold for the printing ofthe book.And, um, what percentage of form submissions here do I think might actually buy a book?Now, I could get this qualitative data later, but I don't have this data now, and I still want togive Google some benchmark value.So if I think 25%, um, of these form submissions are going to convert, then I cannot pay more than$1.75 per conversion if I want this campaign to break even.So at $1.75 and 1 in 4 people buying the book.I'm basically paying $5 for a new reader who purchased the book break even, and I would be happy withthat.Um, so let's just, you know, when we build out these campaigns, maybe I'll tell Google that ourform submissions will be valued at $2.Um, and as I actually get qualitative data, I'm going to be able to adjust those benchmarks.So we're going to head over to Google.And here is a fresh account.If you sign up for Google Ads account or you create a new account within an MTC, this is what you'regoing to be faced with.And the first thing we're going to do is click New Campaign.Google asks us what the campaign objective here is.Now this is where a lot of people get tripped up because they think that, um, I'm you're going tobe missing out on a lot of opportunities and a lot of a lot of tactics and strategies.It's not true.You have to pick a campaign objective and one you're going to have access to all of the same ad typesand formats as you would in any other campaign.And and if you don't, and if you feel like you made a mistake and instead of choosing leads, you shouldhave chosen awareness and consideration, you can go back and create a new campaign.It's not a big deal.So in my case, this is easy, right?Get leads.I want people to submit this form.So let's get leads.Once I selected my objective I'm going to be I'm going to be asked by Google to choose a campaign type.Now this is where things are more crucial because if I choose display then my search, then I'm notgoing to be running a search campaign.If I choose a video campaign, then I'm not going to be running text ads on search.So, for example, if I go back to sales, I see all the same options.If I go to website traffic, I see all the same options.But Google's going to going to ask a few different questions and just sort of guide you through thesetup depending on your objective.But the campaign type really does matter.So we're here to set up a search campaign from scratch.Search campaign is is the most popular campaign, followed by Pmax.Those are the two most important campaigns for you to really master.So we're going to click on search.And now Google has preloaded a number of additional questions okay.Select the ways you'd like to reach your goal.So for me this is obvious right.Website visits.And we're going to put in our businesses website.So I'm going to go over here grab the URL I'm going to come back and I'm going to give them the homepage.All right.Choose your lead conversion goals.Do I want form submissions for my website.And that's going to that's going to um that's going to give me lead gen forms where I can get formsfrom the ads themselves.We discussed the lead form extension.This will be a very similar experience.Or do I want phone calls, sign ups, um, or form submissions from your website?Now I'm select I'm presented with two options here that seem very similar.Right.Form submissions from your website.Gather leads information through a form on your site, some coding may be required.That's going to be for the conversion tracking setup.Sign up.Show your ads to people who are most likely to sign up, or that's a typo.Show your ads to people who are most likely to sign up for a free newsletter or trial.Create an account or pre-register.Okay, now what does that mean?That's also a form submission.Now what's happening here with sign up are likely Google having a good understanding of people who respondto offers.Okay, so I would avoid the sign up generally.Lead conversion goal because I think Google is likely going to show ads to people who will sign up,but very unlikely people who will take action.And if I get a lower quality audience than my 25%, math doesn't work.Um, so again, we have book appointments, quote request, get directions outbound click.So do I want to show ads to people who are more more likely to engage with my website's content andclick off of my website to.Somewhere else.Or show your ads to people who are more likely to visit a business like yours.So this is very good for retail, especially in fashion or in home repair services, where Google hasa very clear understanding based on online browsing activity, what market and what services peopleare in the market for.So in my example, I'm going to go back to the standard form submissions of our site.And I'm going to name our campaign.This is going to be pre-order Scatter Plot Search.Okay.Google now presents me with the option of turning on enhanced conversions.I typically leave enhanced conversions on because this is going to give Google the best possible modelof all conversions.Okay, so Enhanced Conversions uses information customers provide on your website, which can improvemeasurement and optimize your campaign.This is allowing Google to access some of the personal information that Google will anonymize it, andthey will not sell it, and they will not use it for their own targeting.But if Google has read access to email addresses and personal information, it could help them buildthose better.We call them behavioral paradigms.It could help them better understand who our people are so they could eventually find more of them.Agree and continue.Okay, create a new campaign or finish a saved draft and go back.We're going to click agree and Continue start new okay, so now I'm continuing through my conversionsetup.What do I want to focus on?I want to focus on conversions right I don't want to focus on conversions value.This is lead gen.So I want to maximize conversions.I have the option to set a target cost per action.So over here this is maybe where I would set that $2 target.Now I know from my experience with Google search that's a low target.However, if and in my cases when I actually launch this campaign, I'm probably going to launch itwithout a target, but it might make sense.It might be worthwhile again, depending on the financial factors, depending on how risk averse, dependingon how conservative you want to be, you could add that target.So for me, $2 gives me with a 2530 ish percent conversion rate for people who would actually buy thebook, who sign up when the book comes out.Um, that's going to be that would be the cap.I want Google to aim for bid for new customers only.So right now this wouldn't this this option wouldn't make a difference because I don't.Google doesn't have any information on previous customers.This is a fresh account.But if I was setting up this campaign within an existing account, selecting bid for new customers onlywould tell Google that I only want to, um, I only want to find people who are not my existing customersthat have not been to my site before.Now Google says I have to define an existing customer list in order to exclude them.So then I would define an existing customer list if I had it.So I'm going to leave this unchecked and I'm going to click next.And now I have a few more important options.Do I want to be on the display network and do I want to be on the include in the Google search partnernetwork?So within this search campaign, Google, if I give them text ads, will run my ads on the display network.But I don't like the display network.I don't want to run my ads in the display network.I'm looking to see what results and what value I can get from just the search network, which I knowis going to bring me a higher quality audience.Now I can include this.Google search partners.Google Search Partners is like AOL, MSN, other, big, um, other big publishers that have searchfunctionality oftentimes use and they monetize their search feature with Google advertising.So you have the option of excluding that and only showing on Google Primary.Or you could include the search partners.I typically begin by excluding the Google search partners.Um, because I don't want to pollute my data with potentially worse performing traffic from the searchpartners, all countries and territories.I'm going to stay just in the United States because when the book comes out in the beginning, it'sonly going to show to people in the United States.It's only going to be shipping to people in the United States.It's important to twirl down this location's options.You have presence or interest and just presence.So presence or interest is a tricky way of saying that Google can show your ads to people outside ofyour selected location if they're regularly interested in that, in that location.So, for example, let's say you have somebody in France who likes American baseball.So he's constantly looking at French.He's constantly looking at like sort of French.Um, uh, YouTube.He's he's on YouTube and he's searching.He's searching his, his, his browser for, um, New York Yankees highlights often.So he's expressing interest to Google that he's interested in the United States.So now he might be somebody that Google shows my ad to if I had presence or interest, but if I toggleover to presence, then Google is only going to show my ad to people regularly in our included locations.So if that person in France does not live in the in the United States, or is not regularly in the UnitedStates now, he will not get that ad.And that's the toggle that I want.Select the languages your customers speak, right.We want to avoid Google showing our ads.My ads, which will be written in English to people who do not speak English.So this is nice of Google to pre select English for me and I'm going to keep that selected just likethat audience segments.This is a this is when we started talking about targeting versus observation okay.Now I'm going to launch a campaign and then come back and add my audience segments.However, we could start browsing through a couple categories just to get a feel for how we would setup, um, how we would set up observation in audience segments.So let's say I could type in fiction.So I like it in market for books, in market for board games, in market for educational resources.Book lovers is affinity audience, sci fi and fantasy.Now let's see.Let's go back.Let's type in books.Sometimes the search feature doesn't work so well, but you can go into browse and I could say who theyare.Detailed demographics.So I think I want to show parents, um, parents of grade schoolers and parents of teens.Okay.Um, I want to show my ads to those people.Because these are people who might be buying the book.And again, I have everything here is on observation, so don't.I'm not narrowing narrowing the reach of my campaigns.But I'm going to have reporting and I'm going to be able to observe.Is there a meaningful performance difference with the audience segments in any of these categories?Now I have a selection for broad match keywords.Um, broad match keywords work with smart bidding to help you reach your campaign goals.So Google by default has on use broad match keywords for our entire campaign.Or do I want to be able to control my campaigns with keyword match types?Okay, so as you could see from all of these pre-selected options, Google wants you to spend as muchmoney and be as broad as possible.Not so.You're just spending as much money.Google is not evil in that sense.They're not looking to fleece you for the next three days and like, trick you out of spending 60 bucks.They want you to spend with them forever.So they want you to be successful.And what Google is seeing is the the the the the less we meddle and restrict Google's algorithms Andlearning what works the better most of their campaigns are.So in my case, I'm actually going to keep this selected, keep broad match on for my entire campaign.If I click the more settings wheels I have, the optimized I have, I have the pre-selected optimizedfor best performing ads.I always leave that on.I don't usually create an end date unless a campaign does have a specific end date.I'm going to allow my ads to run all day, and I don't have any specific brand inclusion or exclusionlists right now, so I'm going to click next.I have my final URL.So Google is going to Google is going to begin um helping create some some keyword generations.So what makes your product or service is unique.So I'm going to go um, I'm actually going to go into my, to my GPT, which I have, I have a ChatGPTthat has my manuscript, and I'm going to write, um, please provide a two paragraph Synopsis.Of the novel.Also write a third paragraph comparing this novel with ten current.Why a and middle grade authors and their titles.In the United States.Okay, so this is going to help me give a little bit more rich information to Google.Um, and Google's going to hopefully be able to use this information to come up with some interestingkeyword suggestions for us to at least begin with.Okay, so Rick Riordan, that's a good one.J.K. Rowling nice.So much.Um, chainani.Lemony Snicket, Jonathan Stroud.Okay, this is good.It's a good list of other because one of the one of the campaigns or the ad group structures I liketo do is, is competitive campaign.So people searching for other authors.So let's grab this.Let's go back to Google.Um, let's paste that in.Oh okay.I'm 300 characters overboard here.So let's just take out a little bit of the synopsis.Uh, okay.We could grab that and we're going to generate.Okay, so Google is not able to give me any keyword suggestions because I think the password on thewebsite is causing an issue.However, Google was able to take my suggestion and give me 15 headlines.Now, these are not great headlines, but they might be interesting starting points.And I could use the AI here on the side in the chat, um, to generate more headlines and descriptionsfor example.You don't have any responsive search ads with ad strength under average in your account.That's not what I asked for.So sometimes this is wonky.Um, write ten more headlines for my middle grade novel based on the above description.Okay, so sometimes the Google chat doesn't work.We'll end the chat and we'll go right back here.Okay.So we're going to enter product or services to advertise instead.Middle grade fantasy adventure novel titled Georgie Summers.And the Scribes of Scatter.Plot.Okay.Click keyword suggestions.Fantasy novel.You sometimes have to give them a few more.Or you need a final URL that's going to work.Okay, so here we go.So we have some keyword suggestions.Um, now I could copy these, but Google also has them, um, put right here in a plan which estimatesconversions my cost per conversion and weekly cost.But don't look at these estimates because they're almost always like wildly inaccurate.Um, so my final URL is going to be this pre-order page.So I'm going to come grab the pre-order page.Here's the URL back into Google.Paste the pre-order page.Good display path Georgia Summers.Com and I'm going to leave it as that.Headlines.Um, so let's go and write some headlines.Um for maybe I'll say for fans of Rick Riordan.Georgie Summers.Um, I'm not going to be able to write.And the Georgie Summers.Novel is here.Okay.Magical adventure quest.A new hero is born.Limited edition pre-order.Join the waitlist for free gift.Maybe we'll do a giveaway or something.Um.Free gift.Join waitlist.Um, so what I might want to do, actually, is, say, Georgie Summers as a pinned first position.Right?So I'll say Georgie Summers and the that'll be pinned in first position.And and the scribes of scatter plot.On sale.Okay, good.And it's not really on sale, but we'll work on that only in position two.So now it says Georgie Summers and the scribes of Scatter Plot.You can avoid that dash on sale.So that would be position one and position two being pinned for something more relevant.And I'm going to get rid of these headlines here.Maybe I'll do something like perfect for Percy Jackson fans.Perfect for Harry Potter fans.Perfect for City of Ghosts fans.Might be too long.Yep.Um.For fans of City of Ghosts.And for fans of The Spiderwick Chronicles, no.For fans of Spiderwick.Okay.Now descriptions.Young Georgie embarks on a quest to rescue his father and uncover secrets.Looking for a new book to read?Discover the truth behind scatter plot.Now I can go into to ChatGPT and say write for 90 character descriptions with a pre-order call to actioncannot exceed 90 characters, including spaces.Let's grab this one.Go back into Google.Okay, let me just quickly grab the other ones here.Too long.Sometimes ChatGPT is not great with character limits.All right, I'm gonna get rid of that one.Um, I don't need to add business name and logo right now.Site link.And.Okay, so we can come back and add all these extensions later.We went through an example and look, I, I didn't include I should include fantasy novel in the keyword.Right.So if I, if I, if I say if I go to view ideas under include popular keywords, I could add fantasybooks, fantasy novels, best um fantasy book series.I'll say fantasy novel for young readers.For young reader, um, best fantasy, best new middle grade fantasy fiction.Best new Ya fantasy series.Okay, so now I've added a bunch of those headlines.It says make headlines more unique.So it wants, you know, you could say order online free gift, limited edition order online.All right.So it still says my ad strength is poor but it's okay.We added things.We added relevant um we added relevant descriptions and we added relevant headlines.Now if you add if you improve your ad headlines and descriptions, Google is going to give you a readoutof how much of a percent increase you're going to have.But you don't need to worry about.You don't need to worry about all that, all of that for now.Um, we're going to click next.And now we're going to set a budget.Google is going to recommend different budgets.So right now at a $27 daily budget They're going to recommend, um, they're going to suggest that I'mgoing to generate my I'm going to hit my $2 cost per conversion with 93 weekly conversions and a weeklycost of $186.Now, this is probably not going to happen, but I'm going to click next.Or I could go and set a custom budget and Google could show me estimates if I want to spend $100 a day.Um, Google is still showing a $2 and 93 conversions, right?So it's showing that this is what I'm going to get for these keywords.Again, like I said, um, you know, it's really not a well optimized suggestion engine.So I'm going to go back to my $27 a little bit more conservatively, and I'm going to click next.And I'm going to be able to review, um, before I publish the campaigns.Right.So I have the campaign name, campaign type, my objective, my goal, my bidding strategy, my campaignsettings.I'm going to click and publish campaign.Now we have not yet set up conversion tracking.Um, that's going to be something we absolutely will cover.Google is now saying that it's in review and in a new campaign.Google is going to give you your tracking information.This is important tracking information to once you configure in Google Tag Manager or in Google Analytics,your um, your your tracking, you're going to be able to now tell Google and Google will know everytime a form submission took place on your site.And that way Google will actually understand if I'm hitting that $2 CPA and how to continue to optimizefor better results.But that's the basic process of setting up our first, um, campaign.How to use Google's internal tools a little bit for for research.And if you just did that, and then, of course, the next step is adding conversion tracking.You've built out one of the most powerful campaign types, um, in modern advertising, in the modernadvertising world, a Google search campaign targeting keywords with a responsive search ad with accurateconversion tracking is hugely, hugely powerful.And you're absolutely, um, on your way to enormous, enormous success.And it's it's a very exciting thing.I remember doing this ten, 12 years ago when I first got into this, the excitement around launchinga new Google Ads campaign.And I still feel that that sense of like enormous excitement today, even just walking through this,this, um, book pre-order campaign, it's just there's so many different interesting tactics.There's so much there's so many different areas of intelligence and measurement and creativity thatall go into it.Um, and I hope you feel the same excitement when you're building out your campaigns.Of course not.Not everything goes well all the time.It takes a lot of testing and patience to get these campaigns to work.But if you have a good product and you consistently optimize and you follow our checklist and you havethe requisite patience it takes to see those results, you're going to do very well.Um, and it's it's exciting.So now you know how to set up your first search
