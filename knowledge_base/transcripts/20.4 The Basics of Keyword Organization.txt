# 20.4 The Basics of Keyword Organization

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to briefly introduce keyword organization, which is the last step inprofessional keyboarding for really well built out Google ads campaigns.What is keyword organization is very simple.It's one thing we've done our research, we've done our planning.We understand our competition.We understand all the different keywords we could do.We understand buyer intent.We understand what keywords represent, what likelihood to buy.We have volume estimates.We have cost estimates, right?We really have a good amount of data to play with.Now, what we need to do is take all the keywords that we want to actually bid on and organize theminto tightly themed groups of 10 to 25 keywords.10 to 25 keywords is a guideline.It's not a rule.I don't want to see ad groups that have hundreds of keywords in them.I don't want to see groups that have one keyword in them.People ask me all the time about Scaggs single keyword ad groups, and I don't believe in them.I've tested them, I've tried them.I don't think they work.You might find blog posts that show that they do well.There's probably a lot of variables why they could work.The idea between a single keyword aggregate is that I could write hyper, hyper specific, add textto one given keyword, and with the hopes of having a ten out of ten, a really high quality score,it doesn't play out that way in way in real life.And trust me, I'm bringing this to you from years of experience and thousands of campaigns that I'verun.So you definitely don't you shouldn't have one keyword in an ad group.You shouldn't have hundreds.You should have between ten, 25, 30 keywords in an ad group because those will be chunks of themes.And remember, all 30 of those keywords, if you have 30 keywords in an ad group, are going to be rotatingor going to be triggering the same set of ads for that ad group.So you want to be specific, if you're talking if you're if you're showing ads or people who are searchingfor a specific color of product or specific type or a specific piece of content, then you want to makesure that you're bringing them to the right page, because one of the defining characteristics of anad group is the place that I'm sending them after the click, which is just as important as anythingelse, even though that sort of take place takes place outside of Google ads, where you're sendingthat traffic is is extremely important.And that is decided on the ad group level because that's the final URL, as you remember, of your actualad.So we're organizing, we're taking the keywords that we want to bid on and we're organizing them.We're organizing, organizing them into themes, and we are creating our ad groups.This could take place in Excel, which is my recommended or Google Sheets, which is where I recommend.This is where I like to do this research because it allows me to make mistakes and change things onthe fly as I go along.You could do this in the Google keyword planner.You could actually create these plans and import them into your campaigns.I'm going to show you how to do that.You could use a notebook.I don't recommend doing that.Easy to lose track of and common sense, which, as the saying goes, unfortunately, is not so common.But you could use common sense if you're using a very small campaign and just in your mind, you know,I'm running one campaign, I have four or five ad groups.These are my themes.And you can just build it that way in Google in the Google ads interface without any complication.But if you're building out a larger account with four or five plus campaigns in each one of those campaignsmight have five, 6 to 10, 15, 50 ad groups, depending on your structure, running on your budget,depending on the size of each ad group, etc., then you definitely should be using something like GoogleSheets or Excel to plan this stuff out.At the very least, use Google Keyword Planner themes and we've touched upon this before can take manydifferent forms where the person is in the buyer funnel based on what they're searching.That could be a theme if you're able to send those 2025 keywords to the same either sales page, productpage, service page or piece of content or educational content relevance.How relevant is this search to my product?Is it peripheral?Is it target again?Is it is it are the keywords close enough related that that relevancy creates a unifying theme betweenthe keywords?Because I'm going to write my ADD text that relates that applies to all those keywords and those thoseads are going to rotate either evenly or favor to conversions.But it's not like I could pick one specific ad to one keyword, another ad to another keyword.That is the exact purpose of having ad groups in the first place, which is why thematically relatedgroups of keywords are so important.I just want to write that down because you should remember it thematically related.Groups.Of keywords.That is the defining characteristic of what good ad groups should look like.Remember that?Buyer intent needs based is a person expressing his search where he's saying that he's asking a question,he's expressing his need in the search.He's saying, I'm looking for a actor, he or she.I'm looking for a back, a chair that could solve back problems.I'm looking for a chair that I could sit in all day.I'm looking for a chair that's really light.Does it need space?Is it action words by desk chairs, online by wheeled office chairs online?Is a person searching with those action words that might be a thematically related group of keywords?And I said, Category last, I saved Category last, because that's the most important and most commonway of grouping keywords together.Do this.This product is this color.That's a theme.This section of my website has products that have wheels.That's a theme.This is a service for business consulting.That's a theme.People are searching for this specific piece of content.That's a theme.People are looking to understand how to calculate ROI.I have a blog post that's a theme, and I might have a bunch of different potential searches like that.10 to 25 So category, subcategory, product category, service category.And again, if you remember what we did in the beginning, look at the navigational structure of yourwebsite, look how they look, how the content on your website is actually laid out.That's going to give you a very good sense of being able to structure your ad groups by theme.You know, the tools that we're going to use for keyword organization.And now you have a pretty good sense of the complexity and the scope and the overall story arc of approachingkeywords.In a Google Ads account, we have keyword research, keyword planning, and then keyword organization.You understand the purpose of each of those stages.We understand the tools we're going to be using in each of those stages.And now we need to start talking about the most important component of understanding keywords, whichis match types, and we're going to get right to that in the very next lecture.So thank you for sticking with me this far.I hope you've been enjoying it and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
