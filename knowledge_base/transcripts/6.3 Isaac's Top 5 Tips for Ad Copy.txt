communications in general.This is one of my favorites.Tested Advertising methods, fifth edition by John Caples.Uh, he talks about a lot about headlines, about layout, about descriptions.And even though he's not talking about Google ads in particular, tested advertising methods is a really,um, pretty thick book.But it's it's a great book to have by your side.Um, this is Steve Krug, rocket Surgery made easy, also author of of Don't Make Me Think, an excellentand easy to read and easy to follow guide on landing page design and optimization.But he also talks about messaging and how to

advertising in America.And there's a lot of gold copywriting tips that you'll pick up from reading this book.Um, so I'll put this back on my shelf in a minute, but let's just go through my five condensed tips.Um, as far as a crash course goes.Um, number one, ensure research informs your writing.And this is an easy mistake that most people are making.If your headlines and your descriptions can be written without research about a client's product orservice, you're not writing good headlines.You're writing lazy headlines.So make sure that your headlines, your descriptions include facts and includes ingredients and includes,um, objective numbers and metrics that that are unique to products that you would only know had youread the blogs, the journals, the legislature legislation, the history you visited, the client'sfactory.That's the writing that's going to really appeal to customers.Number two, really good copy can't be stolen by your competitors.So if you have a headline or description.Now I'm not saying this like, look, you can't be overly dogmatic because sometimes you'll say, um,I don't know, learn Google ads and Facebook ads from the experts, then maybe that's a decent headline.Could it be stolen by our competitors who are also teaching courses?Sure.But if all of your writing could just be stolen by competitors, um, maybe a better headline is theGoogle Ads and Meta Ads training, watched by 290,000 students and 188 countries around the globe.Now, that's not something that could be taken by all my competitors, but nevertheless.Right?So good.Really good copy should not be, um, should not be republ by competitors.Three avoid unsubstantiated superlatives.So things like best, um, let's say fantastic.Unbelievable.Impressive.Um.world shattering, earth shattering, jaw dropping.Um, sometimes in the right place in the right time is superlative is appropriate.But if all of your advertising is just a bunch of unsubstantiated superlatives, um, it's not useful.So if you're going to say the number one best selling, back it up.But better to say how many copies you've sold.Um, how many times have you seen a headline?The best software, the best lab grown diamonds, the best iPhone case?Well, what does it mean?The best?How is it the best?Why is it the best?Customers are idiots.They're giving you their money.They're making a purchase decision.People don't treat their money lightly.Whether you're wealthy or not, it doesn't matter.People treat their money with a high degree of seriousness, and they're going to be they're going tofeel more respected, and they're going to feel more compelled to hand over their money to a brand thatis willing to talk to them with more nuance and with more substance.Number four favor subjective favor, objective statements over subjective statements.So, um, if you say we're the most loved, we're the most loved, um, audio loop engine on the planet.That's subjective.Where does that come from?Is it rated somewhere?Do you have that?Um, if you say it's the softest down blanket in the world, if you say it's the the the smoothest rollerballpens money can buy.If you say we're the most fun agency to work with.Um, we're the.We're the fastest HVAC repairmen in town.So those are all subjective.Um, they can be made subjective.So if you could back it up with an objective statement and say, instead of the fastest, you say werespond within 30 minutes, that's much.That's that's leagues better.If you say we're built, we're our blankets are woven with with premium 1200 thread count Egyptian cottonlinen that was tumble dried in in our proprietary process.And you back up with something objective, with numbers and facts that's going to really elevate yourcopywriting.And number five, address specific pain points and needs.So if you if you are thinking empathetically about your customer and this could be from a, from a beercompany to a fountain pen company to a, a lawyer or a healthcare provider, um, anything.Think about why your customers are seeking your solution and address that.And you might get it wrong.You might get it wrong.But but attempt to address a customer's needs.When we're thinking about running ads for the Academy, we're thinking about people are struggling tomake a profit with Google and Meta.Okay, that's a pretty obvious one.Um, if I if I'm advertising a kid's book, maybe that's a little bit harder.Like, what is the need or the pain point that drives somebody to buy a book?It's entertainment.It's escape, it's intelligence.It's seeking knowledge.It's just having a good time.They're all different things.Um, you know, we we went through this exercise when we were running the campaigns for Forbes magazine'sinvestment newsletter.What would drive somebody to sign up

feel like they're not as savvy, and therefore their social credit is not as high.If they don't have up to date information and able to quote big people and thinkers at a dinner party,maybe, maybe that's a little bit closer to the truth.Um, so, so good empathy and having a good sense of emotionality is going to really help you hone inon potential pain points and specific needs.And don't be
