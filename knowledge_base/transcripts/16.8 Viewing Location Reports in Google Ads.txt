# 16.8 Viewing Location Reports in Google Ads

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, I'm going to show you how to go into Google ads and pull up some location reports,because if you want to now make big adjustments and make your spend more efficient across differentgeographical locations, you need to know how to assess how different locations are performing, whetheryou should increase bids, decrease bids, potentially totally exclude certain locations.And there's a lot of things to think about.So let's go ahead and jump in here into the computer.So here we are back in a live Google Ads dashboard of a client that has generated 2833, rather, $33Million in conversion value over the last few months.And we want to see, let's say, how some different locations are performing.So from the Campaigns tab, you could be under search campaigns in the primary and the primary verticalnavigation on the left.You could be under search campaigns, display campaigns or shopping campaigns, and you could analyzeyour geographic results at any of those levels in the menu.But I'm just looking at all campaigns here for for starters, to get a broad overview, overview ofthe entire account.And that's what I will typically do if I'm auditing an account and a lot more on that.When we get into the section of this course that talks about auditing an account that has historic datain it.So we're going to go over to locations here.It's under settings in the in the secondary vertical menu.I don't know if that's what it's called, but that's what I call it.And they're going to click on locations.This pulls up a basic location report.Now, I could sort these columns by clicks, by cost, by impressions.And I'm seeing all these different states that have been getting has been getting activity.So I'm seeing California and it's breaking it down by campaign here.So I'm seeing California twice because there's a shopping campaign and a different shopping campaignthat is both getting a lot of activity in California.So we could see here that California is getting the most amount of traffic right now.Most amount of traffic is not necessarily the key indicator of success of a campaign.It typically isn't usually its conversion rate or it's its profit, it's its return on ad spend.And it sort of depends on what your specific business goal at the time is.And of course, if you're going to look at conversion rate and if you look at profit, you can lookand if you're going to look at conversion value, which is revenue, you must make sure that your conversiontracking is set up properly.And of course, we will have a separate section of this course that specifically deals with installingand configuring and diagnosing your conversion tracking.So anyway, so I can see here a breakdown of all the different things that are going on.So I could say, Och, California is doing really well.It has a 7.9% conversion rate for this campaign and I might want to make a bit adjustment, right?So if I say 7.9% is a little bit below the the overall average of the account.Right.But it's still performing at a conversion value divided by costs that I that I like, which in conversionvalue divided by cost is your return on that spend.We'll talk about that again in the future.I know I'm always saying we're going to talk about that in another lecture and it's true, like we reallywill.But of course, once we're getting into a live account, there's so many different concepts that arereally overlapping.But if I say I want to, I want to bid more aggressively than I'm bidding in that campaign.So in that campaign I have bids for every single product.Now I want to do something on top of that.I want to say where if I have this AMJ shopping bid, LPI stands for low priority.If that campaign has a product in it or a product group or an ad group that has a $3 bid, I want tomake a bid adjustment of 20%, let's say.And so I'll be bidding an extra $0.60 on that bid.So I'll be bidding a maximum of $3.60.I want to be more aggressive in that location.I could simply click edit and increase my bid by 30%.Right?So it tells me a $10 bid becomes a $13 bid, and that's just an example.That doesn't necessarily mean that my account has $10 bids and you'll see those same messages in youraccount.Those are just templates.So now I have a 30% bid adjustment which is acting on top of the bids I have in my campaigns that arethat that this location report is referencing.I'm going to remove that if I click into a if I click into it again and I just go to zero and I clicksave, there will be no bid adjustment and it's and it's as if it was deleted.Right.I could also select a number of bid adjustments that I have here.Let's say I had bid adjustments.I have a bid adjustment in Florida.I could click edit and I can remove those bid adjustments or I could change the bid adjustments in bulk.So if I wanted to have all these three locations have a -5% bid adjustment, let's say I would clickdecrease 5% click apply.And I'll have a -5%.But I've just been over there, so.Right.So I could go back and select them again and just remove those bit adjustments, remove three locations.Now removing those three locations is not going to really doesn't mean remove the three locations,it's just going to remove the bit adjustments that I have set on those locations and I'm to go backto Florida and increase it by 10% again and click save on the individual level.So you see it's pretty easy to set up these bit adjustments.The hard part is understanding when you should be setting up those bit adjustments.The harder part is knowing when you actually should be making the adjustments and how much of a bitadjustment you should be making.And we'll get to that when we talk about formulas for calculating what the appropriate max CPC bit shouldbe.And remember, you can always reference back to our calculator that we talked about to get a sense ofwhat your maximum CPC should be at any given time.We're looking here at a targeted location report.If I go to excluded at the top, I'm going to see a list of all the locations that we've excluded.And you notice that there's no area for bid adjustment over here because these are totally excludedlocations.If I go to Geographic report, we can start seeing some really cool stuff.So first I'm going to click on Geographic Report.And I see a bunch of states and looks very similar to my original Target report.This is where you really want to come and start drilling down to see specific data.Right now I'm looking at the region level, all countries region.So we're looking at a region report now.But I can go back and click on this dropdown menu and select any of these other dimensions.So I could go down to look at neighborhood borough if it's close to an airport municipality, county,congressional district.There's all sorts of really interesting things that I could look at.I could also just click on all countries above, and now I'm looking at a much higher level of all countries.So you can see in this campaign almost all of the traffic is coming from the United States.Right.And some other countries have a few different impressions here and there.And there are reasons why that could happen.But it's so small that we would ignore it.I wouldn't even be bothered by showing 30 impressions over the course of six months.In Canada, we're dealing with millions of impressions, 79 million impressions, right.In the United States, you might be wondering why you're seeing two separate location items for theUnited States.Well, one is called location of interest.One is physical location.And it's very simple what those two things mean.Physical location means that the user was actually in that location, whatever location is here on theleft when the ad was triggered.So when they clicked and got that, when the impression happened in the click happened, they were physicallyin the United States.And of course, we see far more impressions than clicks or people who are in the United States.Location of interest means it could be somebody from out of the US was expressing interest in furniturestores in the US or online sofas in the US.Somehow they added that to their search term.They might have used a the name of a state or the name of a city when they were searching.And Google determined that we wanted to show them an ad based on the fact that they're expressing interestin our targeted location.And in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how to to modify those rules, how Google treats that.But you see here a minuscule percentage of traffic coming from location of interests.If I want to now drill further back into let's say you go back to region, because that's really whereit's going to be helpful for me in this account to start making decisions based on location data.I'm simply going to click United States and select region or state.So let's I go ahead and click state and now I'll be back in the state view that we were looking at previously.Actually we were looking at region, but it's similar.You'll also notice that we're not seeing the ability to modify bids over here because this is just alocation report meant to assess how my campaigns are performing.So if I want to if your client asks you, you want to know where am I getting the most clicks from?So you go into your state or your location.If you want to go into zip codes, fine.And you sort by click.So I see we're getting the most in California, the next in New York.So I start getting a sense of how this campaign is performing.Where am I spending the most?Usually where you're getting the most clicks?California, New York, where is my conversion rate?The highest?Okay.Now I'm going to sort by conversion rate and I'm probably going to see some anomalies.Right.And we have to talk about anomalies.So exactly.Here's a beautiful example of a of an anomaly.Vermont has a 253% conversion rate, which obviously doesn't make much sense how you can have above100% conversion rate.There are reasons why that could happen.Google could back count certain certain conversions if a same person converted twice through one click.So I'll see three clicks, but potentially seven conversions depending on how you're set up your countingof a conversion in Google ads.But it's an anomaly.So we can't assume that most and it's such it's such low volume that making optimizations for Vermontdoesn't really help me much as we move down into Mississippi.Mississippi has a 37% conversion rate.Again, very low amount of conversions.Very low amount of clicks to.Really.No, but I'm seeing California has a.20% conversion rate.And this is really significant.This is actual real data.So now I know I want to start doing some things in California to make to see if I can capture more ofthat market share.So I might now return back into my targeted tab.Fine California.And I could and I could filter by all campaigns that have California and that remember that this isa campaign overview report.So if I just increase my bid in California here, I might not I'm not going to be increasing my bidin all campaigns that are targeting California, cause I have a bunch of different campaigns in thisaccount, so it might look different for you.So you can't actually filter from this report all targeted locations that include California.But there's a pretty simple workaround.I want to first make sure I have all of my locations showing up on this page, so I'm going to scrollto the bottom and I see that I have 100 out of 243, so I'm going to click to show 500 rows and thenI'm going to do a simple command find or control find on windows and type in California.And I'll have highlighted all of the targeted locations that have California.So I'm just going to select.Select.I could go down up here, select it again.And select two more.And I think we got them all.Is there one more?Looks like we got them all.So now all I need to do is edit change the adjustments and say I'm going to increase my bid 15%.Now, of course, I know that 15% makes sense for us in this case because I know what our Max CPC bidsare for California already.So I'm able to say that bid plus 15% will still keep me in the range of profitability because I knowthat I have an above average conversion rate for that targeted location and that sort of formula appliesin any area, making a big adjustment if we're making a bit adjustment for gender for men versus male,male or female or anything else, you want to use these formulas based on what your max EPC bid is,what your conversion rate is, and what your profit is for that location or for that demographic orfor that whatever that dimension is that you're increasing or decreasing the bids on.Now that I have that done, I can deselect it.And that's basically how to start getting interesting geographic reports.Just go back in one more time.I could also look at per store reports.If you have multiple locations, we don't have that.In this case, I could look at a user location report, which is the same thing as the Geographic Report,but it just focuses on where the user location, where the user actually was when they clicked an ad.When you go back into the Geographic report, remember you could always switch between campaign andlocation view.If I toggle into campaign view, Google ads will show me a few more columns by default.Like what that bid adjustment is for that area.Again, it's not editable from here, but you could see it and you can see which campaign it's referencing.So I'd like to go back into.I typically go look at location view.I just like it better.It's it's cleaner and I'm mainly looking for how overall locations are performing and I'm not necessarilylooking at it always at the campaign level, but when you are looking at it for the campaign level andyou should do that analysis as well, then you'll toggle it into the campaign view and again use thesedifferent dropdown menus to go even further into your data.So if I go into city, let's take a look at what that might might look like in the report and then we'llwrap up because I don't need to go through every single one.Like I said, every single one of your campaigns is going to be different.How your targeting your campaigns are going to be different.If you're if your campaigns are only being targeted to a specific state or to a specific location ora radius targeting, then you're going to want to always look at, let's say, postal codes within thator neighborhoods within that, right?So over here I'm looking at cities.And of course, if I saw buy clicks, they were going to have a lot more data to go through.And you could download this these reports and play with them in Excel as well.Any report you see in Google ads is downloadable.If I scroll to the bottom here real fast, I'll see that I have 24,364 locations.That's quite a bit of information to run through.And for an account like this that's spending this amount of money, it doesn't make any sense for meto be wasting time analyzing by city level.That's another thing that you have to remember as you're optimizing these campaigns in the age of theamount of data that we have is that it's very, very easy to get overwhelmed by data.That's irrelevant.So will I maybe find some interesting trend in a specific city?Yeah, but and that and like if you're, if you're getting your account, if you're pitching your accountto an agency or somebody telling you that they can make your account better because they say, Oh,look, I'm in Dallas, it's a half a percent better conversion rate.We should.Yeah, but it's not practical to, to optimize a campaign that way.You're going to get bogged down in minutia and you're not going to have time to do the things that aremuch more important.It's much, much more important to be spending your time optimizing across a range of dimensions ina Google Ads account.You need new keywords, negative keywords.You need to be changing your bit.You need to be a B, testing your ad copy.You need to be working on scoring.You'll be doing affinity audiences and remarketing audiences.There's a lot to do.So when it comes to location optimizations, look at the highest level that you think makes sense overan account like this.It would be at the state level.For most accounts, servicing the country would be a state level.If you're looking with if you're only targeting within a small location or a radius targeting, thenof course drill down the next level below.So I always recommend going the next reasonable level below and take a look at your data.And if you want to quickly just quickly, just to wrap up, if you want to download data into Excel,you click the download button and you can download whatever report you're looking at in an Excel file,and then you can have fun with your pivot tables.And I'm going to go into an Excel as we talk about quality score and keyword thematic groups of keywordsand a lot of a lot of exciting stuff to talk about.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about the advanced location targeting settings for exclusionsand targeting.It's worthwhile to really understand that because they can make a big impact on where your ads actuallyshow up and who sees them.So on that note, I do look very much forward to seeing you guys soon in the very next lecture.
