# 4.6 Brand Inclusions and Brand Exclusions List

Welcome back.We're going to talk quickly about inclusions and exclusion lists.So to create a new brand inclusion or exclusion list, navigate to tools inside the Google Ads dashboard.And then to the Brand Lists tab.That's where you're going to be able to create a new list, apply it, or deselect it from an existingcampaign that you had previously applied it to.Welcome back.Let's talk about negative keywords in a little bit more depth.Negative keywords allow you to optimize ad performance by removing irrelevant or harmful search terms.There are two types of negative keywords one.Account level negatives.These are negative keyword lists and negative keywords or key phrases that you input at the accountlevel and they will apply.They will impact all the ad groups across all the campaigns in your account.Number two, we have what we call sculpting negatives.Negatives are not meant to avoid triggering any of your ads.Sculpting negatives are negative keywords you add at the ad group level to direct certain search queriesto specific ad copy that you specifically want triggered for that search query.For example, let's say I have a sale or a specific promotion on a certain model of sneaker or a certainmodel of pen or a certain service I'm offering, and I have a campaign or an account that has a fewcampaigns, and there's multiple keywords across these campaigns that might trigger a search for thatspecific brand.Let's call it New Balance.I have a special promotion on New Balance sneakers, and it's a really appealing promotion, and I wantto specifically have ad copy that highlights my competitive advantage with New Balance sneakers.So I've written an ad and an ad group that says New Balance on sale 35% off for a limited time only.So on and so forth.I have some other ad group that one of the keywords in that ad group or that campaign are, um, itjust says men's sneakers.So certainly an ad for New Balance or a search query for New Balance might trigger an ad from that campaign.But that campaign or ad group just has general ad copy that talks about my general competitive advantagesfor men's sneakers, which is not as strong of an advantage as my competitive advantage, or what Ihave to say, or what I would like to say about New Balance.So I would add New Balance as a negative keyword in the ad group that has the general keywords.And when Google looks to that ad group to see if they should trigger an ad, they say no, there's anegative keyword, New Balance, and then it will force Google to trigger a keyword in the ad groupthat has the New Balance specific copy, because there won't be that negative at that ad group level.So a negative keyword at the account level impacts all campaigns and all ad groups inside that account.A negative keyword at the ad group level could be used to avoid a search query from triggering an adin that specific ad group, but it would then redirect Google's system to see if there was another keywordelsewhere, and another matching ad elsewhere in the account that would be eligible to show for thatsearch query.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about negative keywords for more from a philosophical perspective,from a strategic perspective, and I'll see you in a moment.
