# 7.4 The Case for Manual Bidding

Welcome back.Let's talk about the case for manual bidding.There are some cases where manual bidding might outperform smart bidding.For example what we call catch all campaigns.This is where we would bid much lower than a typical average CPC.For example, we might want to have a really broad net, and we just want to see how cheap we can getcertain traffic.And you're going to get less traffic, you'll get fewer clicks, but you're going to end up paying muchless per click.You're going to have lower conversion rate, because these are going to be users and searches that areexpressing much less commercial intent, but still cost effective.Maybe you want to bring people into an informational page.Maybe you want to just bring people on the off chance that they're going to convert.We've seen this work, and oftentimes when we're building a campaign from scratch, our core campaignswill be smart bidding campaigns.But then we'll have what we call a catch all campaign.With a relatively low daily budget, really low CPC bids.And let's just see what can get that.What?Let's just see what Google can give us through the filter where you can pick up that extra cheaper trafficand conversions.You could use it to supplement main campaigns, not replace them.And they can work really well because Google sometimes does misjudge conversion rates, and they doallow some low cost clicks to still convert, meaning the more expensive clicks are going to come fromthe users that Google is predicting are more likely to convert.That's why they're bidding more aggressively.But Google doesn't always get it right.There are a lot of people who Google thinks have a really, really low likelihood to convert becausehuman behavior is very, very difficult to understand even with this amount of data.And people ultimately are very unpredictable.So with a, with a, um, with a, with a very low, with a very low bid, um, you might be pleasantlysurprised in how much traffic you can actually get and what those costs might ultimately be.I could actually give you an example of that very dynamic at play in a campaign that I was looking atthis morning.So here's an ad group for a, um, a campaign we're running to generate traffic to the Adventure Academy.And if I go into campaigns on the left hand side here, just start and we'll see our ad groups.So I have $130 a day budget.And if I click into here, I'll see my one ad group that we have running now broad all Google keywords.This is sort of like a catch all campaign because I have a very low target CPA.It's not set as manual bidding, but I want to illustrate to you how cheap certain CPCs can get.So over here here's a paused keyword.Best PPC companies.The reason why I paused it is just it's not a keyword that's generating traffic for people who wantto purchase premium educational content.But it's still this would be a great keyword for our for our agency.But I was shocked to see 97 clicks at a 13% click through rate, which is really high at $1.66 a click.Best PPC companies is a keyword that appears in other campaigns and ad groups of ours, where we'regenerating traffic to our agency side, people who are looking for managed services.And we have a target CPA of something like, I don't know, $400 for a form submission, and this keywordis costing 30 to $40 a click.And over here in this campaign, with a much lower target CPA bid, we're getting $1.66 a click.So it's quite incredible when you have a catch all strategy.What can happen in that environment?Another very, um, likely or possible use case for manual CPC bidding is a brand new campaign launchedwith no prior conversion tracking data.Now, there's a lot of, um, there are different opinions in the field about whether or not it is prudent.It is wise to launch a new campaign with no conversion data.Um, as with target CPA or target Roas or maximize clicks or some sort of some sort of smart biddingstrategy.Some believe that it's better to start with manual CPC, and then once there are some conversions inthe account, switch to target CPA or to target return on ad spend.However, there is nothing wrong and we've seen hundreds of campaigns work just launching out of thegate with a smart bidding strategy.However, in certain scenarios, or if you just wanted to test it with an account that has no priorconversion history, it might make sense to launch a campaign with manual CPC bidding.And again, I also gave you an example earlier that you might want to use a manual CPC campaign notto bid lower, but but to bid more aggressively, but to maximize.And, you know, you might have a really strong search term or keyword that exactly relates to yourproduct.And you might want to have a really aggressive manual CPC bid inside that campaign or ad group.Now let's talk about competition.We've covered bidding strategies, and in the next lecture we're going to begin understanding the competitionand how understanding the competition can help us manage our own costs.
