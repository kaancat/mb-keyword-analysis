# 22.5 When You Could Ignore Low Quality Scores (and when you can't!)

We briefly mentioned earlier that there are certain times it's okay to ignore quality scores.Let's take a closer look at some of the more common situations where these exceptions apply.The most common exception to the quality score rules are what I call pains doesn't really stand foranything specific.The SATs are painfully annoying and inconsistent numbers syndrome but we call them that because theseare instances that can't be understood by any logical boundaries.Sometimes the plural version of a key word will have half the quality score of the singular versionof that key word in the same group.There's no logical reason why that should be the case.Sometimes adding a prefix or a suffix to a word changes the quality score dramatically like sofa coversand sofa coverings.These instances and others that have no rhyme or reason can be very frustrating as you continuouslytry and fail to optimize for quality score.In these cases you should try a few tests and if you don't see any positive results just walk away whetheror not that means removing the troublesome keyword is a question that needs to be addressed on a caseby case basis new accounts and new lists of keywords every new keyword is assigned a default qualityscore that is not necessarily reflective of the quality score your new keywords will have tomorrow orthe day after.You need to wait a little bit before making any assumptions about the health of a new key words qualityscore.As a rule I don't begin worrying about quality scores before key word has at least 1000 to 1500 impressionswith 100 to 250 clicks once the keywords and add Roop has accrued some actionable data then you canstart taking a look at how good or bad your quality scores are.However if your account indicates that there is an issue with your landing page that's something thatyou should take a look at right away.In most cases landing page issues that are diagnosed right away don't go away with time.We've seen a number of cases where there's quite literally an industry glass ceiling you hit with qualityscores the legal financial and pharmaceutical industries are familiar with this issue.Some of these industries have gotten a bad reputation with Google after a day lose of advertisers sendingtraffic to shady and untrustworthy sites as a result.Google adopted a guilty until proven innocent policy with certain keywords.We've run into this obstacle with our clients a number of times where no matter what we did we couldn'tget past a three or four quality score in these cases.We persisted and we eventually were able to improve our quality scores dramatically over time.If you suspect something like this is happening in your account reach out to a Google rep and ask themto take a further look.If you see a lot of three quality scores and you're averaging a position one to three you can be fairlycertain that this is the issue you're running into who won't generally show three quality scores abovethe organic results.And if they are you're most likely advertising and one of the blacklist industries if that's the casekeep on truckin don't worry about inflated prices because chances are your competitors are averagingthe same quality scores and CPC as you are.It's common for companies to serve ads when people search for a competitor's name.In fact we've seen some excellent results with these sorts of campaigns for our clients.It's a great opportunity to highlight your sales and promotions in ethical way as long as you're notclaiming to be the other company or denigrating their products or services.Since Google knows the user's search specifically for a company that is not yours you'll almost alwayssee low quality scores on these keywords.For example if someone searches Google for State Farm motorcycle insurance and Geico targets the keywordState Farm.GEICO is going to get slapped with a low quality score once again whether or not you should continueto run these sorts of campaigns with low quality scores has to be assessed on an individual basis.This kind of problem can arise even when you're not specifically targeting your competition.If you sell a product that has the same name as a well-known company you might see low quality scoresfor that products.Keywords in most of these cases simply ignore the low quality scores unless as a result your key wordsare no longer profitable.We talked earlier about the inability to track historical quality scores within an outwards account.In other words you can't see higher quality scores change over time in larger accounts.It's also difficult to find the areas of your account in which quality scores suffering the most.There are ways to accomplish both of these things manually and will cover both those things in the nextvideo.But there's an extraordinary tool available.I wanted to show you that can make your life so much easier.Optimizer is a multi-dimensional PPC tool with a ton of different features but one of the most usefultools they offer is the ability to track historical quality score and diagnose problematic quality scoreareas.In a sense I'm going to take you inside the optimizer dashboard right now but if you're serious aboutmanaging your Edwards account I highly recommend signing up for an optimizer can.Their prices are very reasonable and the time you'll save makes the monthly cost well worth it.You can find a link to their website in the video description below.Now let's take a look at their quality score tracker tool.So here we are in the optimizer historical quality score tool.We're seeing real data from one of our clients accounts at the top.We can see the overall count level quality score and how it's changed over the selected date range.In this instance we see the overall quality score was down from a 7.6 to a 7.4 not a very significantchange.I'm not usually concerned with the account level Claudie score for two reasons.One it doesn't tell you where you need to optimize and to.Since we're always testing new keyword ideas that often start off with medium to low quality scoresthose testing areas will be reflected in the overall quality score of the entire account.The daily trends panel below shows us how different key performance indicators like average CPC clicksETR conversions cost per conversion conversion rate average position have changed with changes in qualityscore down here.We have keywords bread and quality score distribution.The key word spread does a great job at showing you the overall health of your county.In this case we're in really good shape with a very strong presence of 70s 80s and 90s.If I roll over the bar chart I can see exactly how many keywords in the account have a quality scoreof a specific numberbut even though I know this account is healthy I also know there are some areas that could use somework.That's why the add groups to optimize section over here is really helpful.I can see which ad groups are averaging low quality scores and how much those outgroups are spending.I see that the AG group named conversion lasso is spending a fair amount of money and it has an averagequalis score 4.7.So do some work on quality score in that group.If I click on it I can see all the data again.But instead of seeing the data at the account level I'm now only seeing historical quad score data forthe group I want to optimize.Right off the bat I see that the work we've been doing so far has paid off.This has been a really hard group and we've been able to get the average from a 3 to almost to 5.That's substantial growth right there down at the keyword spread.I can see that we don't have a very strong showing for keywords with better quality scores in this group.Further down I can see the specific keywords in the group.Their quality scores and their respective costs.If I want to see the historical qualities score for different date range.All I have to do is change the date range select to appear and click refresh.This is one of the optimizer tools we use most often and I can't tell you how much time and energy hassaved us in keeping track and optimizing quality scores across hundreds of accounts.Like I said before you don't need optimizer to track historical quad core data.Now you have a very good understanding of exactly how the Edwards option works how your actual costper click is calculated what your ad rank is.But one very important question remains.How do I diagnose Quad's score issues in my count.How do I figure out which groups which campaigns which keywords are suffering with quality score andhow do I go about fixing those quality scores and how do I determine and inspect my add groups and campaignsto discover the sore spots with what is.And that's exactly those type the topics that we'll be covering in the very next video with a reallycool and detailed Advanced Excel pivot table.It's going to be very informative stuff I hope you really really enjoyed this last chapter because aton of great information you were able with all that information you were able to attain a very deeplevel of knowledge.Your understanding of the average auction is I guarantee you way better than 90 percent of the peopleand the competitors they will be going up against running ad campaigns with adverts so thanks so muchfor watching this one and we will see you in just a second in the next video.Thanks guys.Talk to you soon.
