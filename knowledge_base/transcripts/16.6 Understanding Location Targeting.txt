# 16.6 Understanding Location Targeting

How do you glatz fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, i want to give you an overview of location targeting settings, sort of how to thinkabout them, some of the concepts.And in the next lecture we'll go back into the Google AdWords, the Google Ads user interface, andwe'll configure our location settings in real time.So first of all, only you know how you need to configure your location settings.I can't teach that to you.Nobody could actually teach that to you.If you're a local business and you only serve a certain areas and obviously inherent in your name orthe type of business you are, you don't service certain areas and you do service certain areas.So it's an absolute must.Location settings is an absolute must for local businesses.You might be an international business and you might ship to certain types of countries or whateverit may be.So you have to first start thinking about where do you ideally want to show your ads now say your businessthat sells across the entire United States, right?You're an e-commerce company.That doesn't mean that you should just choose the entire United States.There's a bunch of different things that are important to think about.You might have higher margins or a lower cost per conversion in certain areas.Your shipping costs might be cheaper.In certain areas, you might find seasonality and weather patterns affect your behavior.All these types of conditions that might affect the performance of a different location, that couldbe a state, it could be a city, could be a zip code, it could be you might be you might service peoplein your airports better depending on whatever business you're in.You need to really think about this stuff because when you set up location targeting, you're havinga massive impact on how your ads are actually going to perform.I recommend looking at all your historical data and again I'm referring to the non obvious things,the if you only service a 30 mile radius around your headquarters, if you're a local company, thenit's obviously you service, you know, you focus on that area.But I'm talking about let's say you service the whole country.Let's say you or you service the whole world, potentially.And that could be a service business like we are like.We're a service businesses as we're a digital agency.And we service we have clients all over the world.But yet, if I were to advertise, we don't really run any advertising campaigns, but if I were, Iwould be very specific where I service based on the types of clients I want to attract.So historical data like your CRM, you could speak to your boss, you could speak to coworkers, youcould just think about what's been what what feedback have you gotten from from customers in certainlocations you could use Google Trends.Google.com for its last trends to find out certain searches or certain products that are trending incertain areas or certain services, whether related, again, weather related issues.And then just a lot of your own intuition and that's intuition could be relied upon or at least usedin the place of having good historical data.The best thing to be able to do is once you're running your campaigns for a while, let's say just forexample, nation wide across the United States, you should then look at the data broken down by location,and I'll show you how to do that in the later section.When we go into the concepts of auditing an account and breaking down data in an account, you coulduse your historical data to see, Oh, am I getting more traffic?What about my traffic volume?Am I getting more traffic in New York?Am I getting less traffic in San Francisco?Am I getting a higher conversion rate in Alabama?Am I having a higher order value in Texas?And is the reason that I'm seeing these differences because of the location or is it some other tangentialfactor like it happens to be hotter or colder in a certain location?It's always good to know why geographical variances are happening in terms of the data and the account.It's very good to know those reasons because then I could inform future marketing decisions in a moresophisticated way.Typical guidelines.Major cities will be more expensive.They'll also have the most volume, right?That's something which is this classic push and pull.You want to like you want to always try to get the cheapest clicks, but the the more expensive clickswill be in the areas that are more competitive.And the reason why they're more competitive is because they work better.Always remember that higher CPCs, higher costs per click is not necessarily a bad thing.In fact, and I tell this to clients all the time, it's usually a good thing.Higher costs per click mean that more people are advertising on this keyword and this place at thistime, on this network, and they're willing to pay more.And the reason why they're willing to pay more is because they know that their advertising is working.So don't run away from high cost per click, double down, get involved, improve the efficiency ofyour landing page, improve your quality scores, right?Stay in that game because you'll eventually capture a profitable share of that traffic.Use the Google keyword planner to see where your competitors are bidding.That's a really, really good tool.I'm going to show you how to use the Google keyword planner.It's a really fun tool to get ideas for campaigns, to get ideas for ad groups, but also to see wherewhere the competition is getting their traffic from.And you'll also use tools like SEM.I'll show you how to do that as well in in future lectures.Think about what market you want to be in, right?Do you want to push into New York?Are you running a certain promotion or are you running an event in a certain location that you wantto try to choose?So then you can create a campaign that's just targeting that area.So you can look in the past at your previous historical data, but also look into the future.What are your goals?Where do you want to be and use that to inform what sort of new experimental campaigns you want to berunning?I always say that 20% of your budget should be spent on experimentation.And we're going to talk more about experimentation when we talk about the Lynne Rudnitsky ratio, whichis one of my favorite ways of assessing the health of an account, but I get ahead of myself.So use that historical historical data to inform your decisions, but also think about where you wantto be to experiment.So again, 20% of the budgets always be experimentation that might not be based off of hard data.It might be based off just your desires and your goals and what you where you want to be.And 80% of your budgets should be spent on campaigns that are being optimized over time.And of course, in the very beginning, when you don't have any data, if this is your first account,then it's 100% experimental.Another thing to realize, after you've created your your campaign, you can modify your geo targetingat any time.You could change your location targeting, you could change the location targeting settings.You could remove countries, add countries, move states radius targeting all those types of things.And very, very importantly, you could decrease and increase the bids for certain locations.You don't necessarily have to exclude a location.And this is one of the most important factors in advertising.It's super, super, super important.A lot of times you'll see enormous gains when you're able to increase and decrease bids.So I might be bidding $5 per click, but when it comes to people in Houston or California, I want tobid 50% less.I can add a 50% negative bid adjustment, which means that I'm only willing to pay $2.50 in those locations.And that's a really, really great way to stay in the auction in all locations that you service, butmodifying how much you're willing to bid based on other factors, based on based on your historicaldata of which locations are most successful, in which locations are less accessible.Another trick, which is important, and this is not something which is applicable to every single client,but it's applicable to a lot of clients, is that you should use geo targeting to exclude.Predator locations.Ultimately, this could be a nasty game like your competitors especially.And I've seen this a lot in local markets where clicks are extraordinarily expensive, margins are low.Plumbers, trucking companies, electricians, locksmiths, gardeners, pest control companies, localinsurance brokers.In each of those previous examples that I've just listed, we've seen cases where clicks could be 30,60, $70 per click, and competitors will be clicking on ads.So it's really terrible.It's not a good thing, and it's very hard for Google to prevent that.Google will give you a credit when there's fraud.If Google sees lots of clicks coming from the same IP address, really in rapid succession.But even if it's the same competitor, the same IP address that clicks in your ad four times throughouta day, that's not necessarily fraud by Google system.So what you could do and what we typically do for local service businesses is as clients, here's oneof our little tricks of the trade is we'll get a list of the top five, ten, 15, 20 locations, actualaddresses of our competitors, their offices, their main headquarters.And we'll exclude our ads, a one mile radius around each of their locations.Right.That way, if anybody is sitting in their office and they're doing a search for the products and servicesthat you offer, then your ad won't show up and there'll be no opportunity for them to click your adand run your bill up without having a chance for a conversion.If you're dealing with a hyper local business one mile, two mile, three mile radius, five mile radius,ten mile radius.Then this stuff gets tricky because if you start excluding too many one mile radius locations aroundyour inside, inside your radius targeting, you're going to have very few people left to show ads to.So you have to sort of play that by ear.But it's a really good trick.I, you know, in a in a for sure, in a national campaign, there's a 50 mile radius or whatever itis like that.You might also want to be using location targeting to comply with guidelines like your company mighthave certain restrictions that certain content content can't be promoted in certain areas.And you could use location targeting to make sure that you comply with whatever the guidelines are involvedin your own business or your company's business.Let's just do a quick overview of the features of location targeting.You could do basic exclusions and inclusions.So using Google's location targeting, I could I could specifically target certain locations or I couldtarget all locations and I can specifically exclude specific locations.Those are your basic exclusions and exclusions.Using the advanced search feature in AdWords, you're able to use an actual map and target or excludeby country, region, city or zip code, postal code, right?So you can get really, really seriously focused in a real way when you use radius targeting.We've been talking about radius targeting.You have the option to target anywhere between a one mile and 500 mile radius.So you can't target 0.2 miles and you can't target 800 mile radius.Location groups, which used to be places of interest, airport demographic groups, those were removed.So if any of you are coming from the previous Google ads or the previous AdWords interface, you'renow migrating to Google ads.This is not an option available anymore.Unfortunately, when you're setting up your campaigns in the in the advanced settings section, you'reable to do bulk locations.Bulk locations are pretty cool.You could manually enter or paste in a list of locations.So say for example, my client is negotiating, wants to target ads, hyper target ads, around 200locations where they're giving seminars around the world.So I can get a list of those 200 zip codes in one fell swoop, upload those 200 zip codes into AdWords.And now I have a campaign that's only targeting those 200 zip codes.Right?That's, that's pretty cool.So I could really, really be specific.So anybody who's searching for.A negotiating seminar in any of those zip codes.I'm going to bid much more aggressively than I'll bid in either in my citywide or countrywide or worldwide campaign.So using the bulk locations for those types of businesses could be really, really neat.There's a new feature in Google Ads that was not available in the old version of AdWords called PINMode.And I actually really like this.If you don't have an exact zip code or you don't have an exact address, you could use pin mode to justdrop a pin anywhere in a world map and choose your radius targeting before you drop that pin.And Google will target that location.So again, you can customize the radius of that pin by dropping it, by dropping it anywhere on themap, and it will be a radius of 1 to 500 miles.Just like the other types of radius targeting, you can only target locations in PIN mode.You can't exclude locations in mode.If you want to specifically exclude a location, you have to have the address or you type in a city,state, postal code, etc..Why do you think that is?Well, by now you know the answer.Google doesn't want to make it easy for you to exclude locations.They want to make it easy for you to include locations.You'll get more impressions, spend more money and waste more money.But if you use the pin mode to target locations, make sure you're also using.If you need to exclude specific locations, make sure you use the regular advanced search to excludelocations.And I'll show you exactly what that looks like in the UI shortly.And that's basically an overview of the features of location targeting.In the next lecture, we're going to jump into the Google Ads user interface, play around with theactual targeting for our fictitious campaign that we're building for Poppen.And it's going to be a lot of fun.I will see you guys in a couple of seconds in the very next lecture.Cheers for now.
