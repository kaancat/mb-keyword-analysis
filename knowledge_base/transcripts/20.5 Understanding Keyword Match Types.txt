# 20.5 Understanding Keyword Match Types

How did Google ads fans?And welcome back.Let's talk about keyword match types.We've alluded to keyword match types a number of times throughout the previous few lectures, and nowwe're going to go into each one in much more detail.But first, I want to give you an overview of all the different match types at a very top level.First of all, it's important to have a basic understanding of what keyword match types are.Match types tell Google how much freedom they have.And when when I say they, I mean Google when pairing your keywords with search queries, if you recallsearch queries, search terms queries are different than keywords.Keywords are the phrases and words that you put in your ad groups.Search terms are what people search Google for, and depending on how strict or loose you define yourkeywords by using match types, it will seriously influence which search terms will trigger any givenkeyword.And to get a sense and understanding of that, I have a chart here that will try to hopefully have thisall make sense.There are five primary math types.There's broad match, broad match, modified phrase match, exact match and negative match.Negative match, as it sounds, is excluding keywords.Broad match, broad match, modified phrase and exact match are different ways of letting Google knowhow they should treat search terms in relation to those keywords.Let's take a look at each one of these match types, one by one.And just before we do that.This is really important.It's not just like a little tool or trick in your account.Your account will perform significantly different if it's a broad match keyword or a phrase match orexact match keyword or broad match modified.Your rates will be different.Your cost will be different.The actual searches you're showing up for will be drastically different.So this stuff matters.The strategy with match types matter and understanding the match type.Understanding how how match types work and how they relate to search terms and how they influence whichactual searches you're going to be bidding for an impression on is really worthwhile to getting thisclear.I'll say one more thing.Every account's going to operate different.Again, this is the sort of thing that a lot like a lot of what we're teaching here is there's no specificrule that's going to work for every account.I've seen accounts where broad match campaigns perform terribly, and I've seen accounts where broadmatch campaigns performed really, really well.Usually a good rule of thumb is for there to be a mixture of all keywords, especially in the beginning.And we'll talk about the pros and cons of each individual match type as we get into each match typein more detail.So let's talk about broad match, match type first.The symbol being used for a broad match and every single match type has a symbol.And that's how you identify what that match type is in the account.There's different ways to select, and I'll show you in a minute how these different match types lookin an actual account.For Broadnax, there's no symbol, so it's just your keyword with nothing else attached.Broad match means you're giving Google the most freedom possible when it comes to determining if a searchterm should trigger your keyword to trigger an ad.So let's take a look at an example and we'll take a look at an example for each one.So we have this keyword leather office chair.So that's the keyword we load into the account.Again, there's no symbol our ads might be eligible to show if somebody searches for synonyms of thatkeyword variance of the keyword related terms, different phrases altogether, different words altogether,even different concepts.So for example, an example search term, maybe office accessories depending on Google, depending onhow Google is feeling that day, our ads might show up for office accessories.And I say, depending on how Google's feeling is, because they're always tweaking their broad matchalgorithm.Free office chairs.Desk chair rentals.Right.Just because we put leather in our broad match keyword doesn't necessarily mean that.We're going to show ads when somebody uses the word leather or office or chairs or any of those three.Maybe people will look again.Free desk accessories, right?That's I don't have that on my list, but free desk accessories, that might be a search term that wouldtrigger a ask for leather office chairs.And I'm not trying to scare you away from using broad match.I'm just telling you that there is going to be a seriously strong need for negative keywords and goodnegative keyword lists.And we'll talk about that, of course, in great detail.That's broad match and it's important for an account to have broad match keywords.And we're going to talk about why that is in the next lecture.When we talk about broad match in more detail, let's take a look at Broad Match Modify Broad Match.Modified is my favorite keyword type.I find that it's the best way of having control over what search terms actually trigger your ads whilealso being loose enough to find new ideas to reach or to experiment and be a little bit aggressive.The symbol for a broad match modified is having a plus sign in front of the keyword in your accountand that modifies that term.So for example, if I wanted to have a to have a keyword where I only wanted to trigger, I only wantedto trigger search terms that had chair, desk and leather in it.I would have leather desk chair with a plus sign in front of each word, as we'll see with broad matchmodified, I could modify one of the terms of my keyword or multiple terms of my keyword or all theterms of my keyword.It would be considered broad match modified.The keyword itself would be considered a broad match, modified keyword if there was at least one plussign in front of any of the keywords or any of the individual words in my entire keyword.Ads could show when contains the modified terms plus any other terms in any order.The defining characteristic of broad match modified, let's say, compared to phrase match really isorder.All you're doing with the plus sign is saying that that individual word has to show up somewhere inthe search term, not necessarily in the order of my keyword.For example, example search terms that might trigger your ad is free leather desk chairs, chairs anddesks made of leather.So you could have additional words and phrases appended or pretended to my keyword.But the modified terms, the terms that have that plus sign in front of it have to show up in the searchterm in order for that search term to be eligible to trigger a keyword in my aggregate that will thenin turn trigger an ad impression.Let's take a look at the next match type down phrase match, phrase match.You start getting a bit more control over the search terms that might show your ads, and that is donewith quotation marks.You have quote, you have a keyword in your account enclosing quotation marks on both sides.So for example, we have this example keyword.We would put this in our account office chairs for sale.Let's say again, quotation marks ads can show when the enclosed phrase with appended or appended orwithout words and phrases are in the search term.For example, office chairs for sale near me.Right.We have that entire phrase that I have.In my keyword office chairs for sale.Office chairs for sale near me is not in my keyword, but it's okay.You can have words and phrases appended to them in order and your ad might be still eligible to show.The main thing is that the keyword has to show up in the same order.The entire phrase has to be enclosed in quotation marks.And that quoted phrase, which is why it's called phrase match can't be.Google won't reshuffle that order.It's office chairs for sale.Your ads will not show if sale on office chairs or something like that, where the keywords, even ifall the words are in the search term, if they have to be in that order, that phrase match.And there are pros and cons to phrase match.We'll talk about that in more detail as well.Exact match, which tends to be people's favorite, although it's certainly not my favorite, givesyou the most control over your search terms, over your keywords.And that symbol for exact match is brackets, not the squiggly brackets, the regular brackets, enclosingyour keyword in those brackets.So for example, let's say we have a keyword leather office chair enclosing brackets.That's what it would look like when I load it into my ad group.Ads can show when the exact term or phrase enclose in brackets is what the search term is now.A few years ago, when life was simpler and we were all happier, exact match meant just that exactmatch was exact match.If I misspelled a word, it had to be exact.In order for a search term to trigger an exact match keyword, the search term had to mirror image theexact match keyword that was in brackets.Then Google said, okay, listen, if it's misspellings or very close variance, we're going to stillshow that keyword even if it's exact match.So if somebody misspells a word that they misspell leather will and it's a little bit different thanhow you wrote leather properly, as your keyword will still show an ad for that exact match, keywordcould still trigger an ad.Or if it's a slight variation like plurals, like leather office chairs, Google will show an ad forthat.And then there's now recently Google made a few more changes to exact match that in.Sometimes they call it semantically similar intent and I'll give you some exact examples of that fromGoogle themselves in the lecture in a couple lectures from now when we talk about exact match specifically,but just know that exact match still does give you the most control leather office chair would be theexample search term that an exact match keyword would show up for negative keyword match which is.The most important keyword maps to really understand well because no good Google ads account could everbe as good as it can be, or even close to as good as it can be without understanding negative keywordsand negative keywords really well.And of course, we're going to have a separate lecture dedicated to that.But just quickly, the symbol for negative keywords is that minus sign.So for example, I have these are three potential examples.I might have negative leather, negative free negative chair, exact match.And we'll talk about how three different match types effect negative keywords because negative keywordscould be added using the positive match types.And we'll talk about that, how that all make sense in a couple of lectures from now search terms withoutthe negative term, that's what negative match type is doing.So if I have a negative leather, then no search term that includes leather will ever trigger my adif my negative keyword is applied to an ad group or campaign or a negative cupid list.So for example, desk chairs online would actually trigger my search.You might be wondering, but hey, didn't you just say that chair, which is an exact match?Negative.Google will treat that with plurals and misspellings.Yes.But here's another case where Google wants to make more money.Google will treat exact match as exact match when you add it as a negative.So if the search term includes chairs.Then if you don't have a negative exact match queue or chairs, your ad will still be eligible to show.But there's a second reason.This exact match.Negative is exact match.What that means and we'll talk about this in more detail is that only if I'm only trying to excludethis specifically.So if chair or chairs shows up in a search term, I still want that entire search term to be eligibleto show so free, which is a broad match negative.I don't want any search term that contains free to show, but I do want searches that contain chairlike leather desk chairs or or orange colored desk chairs or whatever it may be, because I have leatherhere as a negative.So desk chairs online is an example of a search and that could show under negative match depending onhow the negative match works.Now, if this is all a little bit confusing to you and if this is a little bit of an overload of information,I totally understand.And it makes a lot of sense, which is why in the following lectures we're going to break down eachmatch type, talk about it in more detail situations when you would use them pros and cons to usingthem and sort of getting a better understanding of how that all works.So that is a an overview of match types.Very, very important to really know them well.You should memorize these match types really clearly.You should be able to answer in your sleep how each of them works, what the symbols are for each ofthem, because your accounts are going to be built out using every single one of these match types.That's how good Google ads accounts are built, all of them together.They work in conjunction with each other.It's they're incredible tools for collecting data.They're incredible tools.Broad match, broad match.Modified are incredible tools for getting new search term ideas.And I'm going to show you how to do all that.So without any further delay, let's go into the next lecture and talk about broad match, keyword matchtype.I'll see you guys in a couple of seconds on the other side.
