# 20.11 Using the Search Term Report to Find Negative Keywords Part 1

How do you Google that's fans and welcome back.In this lecture I'm going to briefly show you how to use the search terms report to find negative keywordideas and add them at the campaign level, the ad group level, etc..We've spoken about how important that search terms report really is.It's one of the most important tools inside Google ads.Negative keyword match type, like I like I've expressed is the most important thing to really focuson as an optimization technique.It should be part of your optimization optimization schedule very frequently, and it's important tounderstand how to use the search report as the primary method of finding negative keywords.There's other research methods for finding negative keywords, like looking at Google Auto suggest Googlerelated searches just your own ideas.But the search terms report is actual historic data that your account has accrued.So without further delay, let's jump into Google ads.And I'm going to show you a couple of different things with regards to finding the search firms report,etc..Here we are back in the Google Ads dashboard and I am under the all campaign section which showing meall my campaigns.This is our account that we've been building out for Poppin.And as you could see through some of the data over here, we've gotten some clicks, we've gotten someimpressions.We have a click through rate of 2.31%.Our average CPC is $2.46 and our total cost is $300.And of course, this is traffic that's being sent to poppin to pop in's website is free traffic forthem.I have nothing to benefit from it, but I'm investing some money just to put some data in this accountfor the sake of this course.But I'm also going to bring you back and show you some other live accounts.If I want to see all the keywords that are active in the in all the campaigns before drilling into acampaign by clicking the campaign name, I could simply go to my keywords tab over here in the secondvertical menu.So I'm going to go ahead and click keywords.And this is a list now of all the keywords.This is what we call our keyword report.This is a list of all the keywords that have generated some clicks.So we see desk chair.If we sort this by clicks, desk chair, the keyword desk chair got us the most amount of clicks withthe most amount of impressions.And going down from there.Office chair, office chair.Office chair is discontinued, discounted chairs by office chairs, etc. And this is very, very earlyon in the campaign.There's not a lot of data.This is not when the search terms report is going to be the most valuable.But remember, the keyword desk chair triggered 36 clicks.But that doesn't mean that desk chair was the search term that got those 36 clicks.All right.That's a very, very important distinction.There are two ways to open up a search terms report.I could either look at a search report for all the keywords in my keyword report.And to do that, we're going to go up here into the vertical navigation, click on search terms andthen search terms.Again, we're not going to into Oxygen Insights.That's a separate report for separate time.If I click on search terms without selecting any given keyword, I'm going to see the search terms thattriggered all the keywords in that search terms report.And again, I can sort by search terms, report by clicks, impressions, click the rate, average,CPC cost and any other columns that I add.And we'll talk about editing and modifying columns at a later time.And over here we start seeing some interesting things, right?We see that dinosaur office chair.Dinosaur office chair for adults.Dinosaur office chair is getting the lion's share of our clicks right now.This is a really good example of search terms report seeming a little bit wacky.I'm not really sure what a dinosaur office chair is, so I don't really know if I should add it as anegative keyword.But there's another reason why it'll be difficult to figure out whether or not dinosaur dinosaur dinosauroffice chair should be a negative keyword.But for the sake of research and I'm going to put it down, I'm going to write it down on the boardreal quick.And I would have this on my notepad.I would say, okay, dinosaur, what's going on with this keyword?We've got to investigate and see if this should be added as a negative keyword or how we should dealwith that.Exactly.Or maybe it should be added as a positive keyword if we see a really good click.And I'm going to go down a little bit if I want to see exactly how many search terms dinosaur has beentriggering or how many search terms that that included the word dinosaur in it.I could select a filter and I make these filters all the time.So I'm going make a filter for search term contains dinosaur, right?And I could come down here.And now I see.Now my search terms report is filtered just for search terms that include the word dinosaur.And I see that there are 31 clicks.Now, I'd be interested to know what percentage of search terms that actually is for all the searchterms that I'm looking for.So I could simply just divide 122, which is the total search terms in the account by 31, and that'slike 25.4%.Now, I'm interested to know what percentage of search terms that include dinosaur is that in relationto the rest of the account?And it's actually really easy to get that number.All I would have to do is divide 122 by 31, and that comes out to be about 25.4%.So 25.4% of my search terms are including this word dinosaur.So obviously it's really, really popular and I should investigate what that is.So I would go to Google, I would figure out what is a dinosaur chair, what are people looking for?So let's just pretend we don't sell that right.We want to add dinosaur as a negative keyword.The question is, if we want to add this as a negative, what match type should we be adding it as notonly what match type do we want to add it as a negative keyword?What level do we want to add it as is it going to be a campaign?Ad group.Or is it going to be a negative keyword list?All right.So we need to answer these questions.So we need to figure out what does dinosaur represent.So say dinosaur.The word dinosaur represents something that we do not sell at all.And that's the easiest type of negative keeper to deal with.Say, for example, we didn't sell dinosaur chairs, but we did sell dinosaur file cabinets, whateverthat meant, then we wouldn't want to add it as a negative keyword.That's totally irrelevant.We would want to add it as a negative keyword for those specific campaigns that are targeting dinosaurchairs, because that's the type of dinosaur product we don't sell.But in our example, let's say we don't sell it at all.It's something that we simply don't sell.But we see we have a lot of these we have a lot of these search terms that we would have to add as negative,says dinosaur office chair, dinosaur chair, office dinosaur chairs.These are all the different searches that have triggered the word I could select.All right.And I saw that have 14 selected and add them all as negative keywords.But I don't need to do that because if you remember, how does Google treat negative broad match?Right.So if I add a dinosaur as a negative broad.If you remember from our previous lecture, that would mean that whenever the word dinosaur showed upat any level of the account that has that negative keyword apply to it, the search term would be ineligiblefrom triggering any of our keywords.So I don't necessarily need to add all of these 14 search terms as negative keywords.And I'm going to show you two different easy ways to do this right now.So I could click Dinosaur Office Chair and select AD as negative keyword, and I'm going to have a fewdifferent options.I could either add it to an ad group.I don't want to do that here because remember what we said, we don't sell Dinosaur at all.I could add it to the campaign or I could add it to a negative keyword list.Unfortunately, we don't have any negative keyword lists set up yet.And I'm going to show you how to set that up set up negative keyword lists in either the next lectureor the one right after.So for now, I'm going to add to the campaign, so I'm going to add it to my office chairs campaign.But remember, if we build out this account and we have multiple campaigns for file cabinets and we'reseeing that dinosaur is a term we're worried about triggering ads and we don't sell that.We don't sell that that product.We would have to add dinosaurs, a negative keyword everywhere.So I'm going to add it to the campaign level.So any of the ad groups, all the keywords that's like this office chairs, office desks campaign endsup having 50 ad groups in each of those ad groups has 50 keywords.Any search term that would potentially trigger any keyword from any of those ad groups that includesthe word dinosaur would now be eligible to show because I'm adding this negative keyword at the campaignlevel now.Google by default if you see here.Adds Dinosaur Office Chair as a exact match negative keyword.Why?Why does Google do that?You guys should know by now the reason why Google's default match type or negative keywords is exactmatch is because it will get you to continue to spend as much money as possible because exact matchexcludes the least amount of possible search terms.If I have a negative keyword, exact match, dinosaur office chair, then if somebody searches for adinosaur desk chair or dinosaur chair or dinosaur office accessories, my, my keyword would be eligibleto be triggered by that search term because I'm only excluding this exact search term.And I don't want to do that.But but luckily I have the option to customize how this keyword is added.So I could just take away the brackets and I could add dinosaur office chair as a broad match keyword.But I don't want to do that either, because if I add dinosaur office chair, then it's going to excludeany search firm that includes dinosaur office chair.I want to make sure to exclude any search term in this campaign that includes the word dinosaur.So simple enough, I'm just going to remove office chair from that negative keyword and I'm going toclick Save.And now that has been added to the negative keyword section of the site.Now there's another additional problem under added and excluded.It says none, because I did not add or exclude the specific variation of that search term.And it's helpful.It's not necessary, but it's helpful to be able to log back in to Google ads and see this added andexcluded column update so you can keep track of what you've done.You can keep track of the work you've done.So if you log in in three weeks from now and you look at dinosaur office chair, oh, I don't rememberif I added that as negative keyword.There's a simple trick to doing that so I can select all of these and include dinosaur and add as negativekeyword and just leave the form at the same edit to the campaign level.Leave the form at the same, leave it as exact match.And if I click Save, watch what happens to that added and excluded column.Now, once I've done that, all of these keywords here show that I've excluded them, which is reallyhelpful because now when I log back into Google ads at a later date, I'm going to see that they'reall excluded.There's another way to add negative keywords really, really easily, and that's just going to the negativekeywords tab.So let me remove this filter by clicking reset.And now I'm going to see all my search terms that have triggered.And I might be looking down and I see, oh, gaming chair.Gaming chair got this three clicks.It costs us two $0.50 click we spend $7 and we know that that's not going to convert because we don'tsell gaming chairs.So I want to add gaming as a negative keyword.We don't want anything to do with gaming.We're not a gaming company.We don't sell any supplies for gamers.So I'm first going to add this as a negative keyword exact match at a campaign level.And remember that I'm the reason why I'm doing that is because I see that now as excluded, but that'snot good enough.I still want to add gaming as a negative ROI match so we could go ahead and do it again the same waywe did it.Or I could simply go over to negative keywords.I could take a look at all the negative keywords here, and I could see what level each of those negativekeywords have been added on.So I see dinosaur with at the campaign level, etc. And now I want to add a new negative keyword.I want to add gaming.So I'm going to click the plus, the blue circle plus to add a negative keyword.I'm going to add it to the campaign level.I'm going to select the campaign.I want to add it to, which is office chairs, and I'm going to write the word gaming.And I could do a couple other things as well.If I want to exclude anybody searching for chairs on Amazon, I could use the word Amazon used, maybeCraigslist, etc. and obviously or eBay.These are ideas that you would get pictures, images.These are these are a bunch of broad match keywords that I'm happy to apply at the campaign level.Now, in fact, you would really want to add these keywords to a negative keyword list because theseare what we would call account irrelevant.I'm going to show you how to set up an account irrelevant keyword list in a little bit, but for nowwe're going to click Save.And that's how we add keywords to the to the campaign level.When we have a situation where we want the negative keyword to be excluded at the campaign level, Ican always navigate back to my search terms report by clicking search terms again.And I want to talk about the second reason why we don't really have the enough data to make the bestdecision.And you probably guessed it by now, we don't have conversion data in this specific Google ads accountbecause this is a Google ads account that we started for this course.I don't have any tracking tags on pop website, so we certainly don't know if any of these clicks aregenerating revenue.That's really those those are really the metrics you want to assess when determining whether a keywordshould be a negative keyword or not.So I'm going to show you in a second in a live account what this process would look like.But again, real quickly, I want to go back to search keywords.And this again is my keywords tab.Say I want to analyze the search terms from just one of these keywords.All right.So I can go down to discounted shares and I say, okay, we got 17 clicks from discounted shares.I want to see which search terms we're triggering just this one keyword.So I could highlight and select this one keyword, discounted shares.And now if I click search terms over here in the blue horizontal navigation that appears when I highlightthat keyword.Now I'm only going to be shown a search terms report that applies to this one specific keyword.So I'm going to go ahead and click search terms and we'll see a much smaller list of 14 search termsthat have triggered this keyword.So I see affordable furniture shopping in American, affordable salon chairs, cheap barber chairs,cheap Egypt furniture, etc. So now affordable salon chairs.We don't sell salon chairs.That's another great idea for negative keyword.So I'm going to click select that keyword, add it as a negative, an exact match.At the campaign level.So it updates.I'm going to just copy the word salon because I don't have to type it and you'll see as you get do this,this is a process that'll go much faster.And now I'm going to select it again at it as a negative keyword and just highlight all paste in salonad at the campaign level as a broad match.Because I want to make sure that any time somebody uses the word salon, if somebody writes cheap salonchairs, or if somebody writes metal salon chairs, I want to make sure that I don't pay to show anad and get that click because it's irrelevant.We do not sell them on our site.It's very unlikely that we'll get a profitable conversion for that search term.Just to go back to that process one more time, you could do this for multiple keywords as well.So if I want to see my search terms for buy office chairs, discount chairs and office shares, I canselect three and click search terms.And now I'll see a search terms report for three of those keywords and that those three keywords showup in the filter.So if I want to remove this filter, I could just click the X button on that filter.And now I'm back to my search terms report for all the keywords in this campaign.One more thing.Once we're in all the search terms for the campaign, say, I want to know what keyword the dinosauroffice chair as a search term trigger, what keyword did kids rolling desk chairs trigger?You could do that by adding the keyword column to this report.So we're going to hit the button columns over here.We're going to either search for keyword or we could find it under the attributes, twirl down and addkeyword.And if I want to see keyword up front really close to my search term, I could drag it and rearrangeit to be the first column in my search and report we click Apply and now I see exactly which keywordwas triggered by every given search term in this report.So dinosaur office chair triggered the keyword office chair.Custom desk chair triggered the keyword office chairs and so on and so forth.We don't need to go through each one and this is not a very big ad group.So this is a small variation of keywords.Now that we finally beat into the search firm's report for the first time, you have a good idea ofsome of the basic principles and adding negative keywords at the campaign level.In the very next lecture, I'm going to take you into a live account and show you how I would go aboutfiltering search terms to find the most valuable negative keyword opportunities.I will see you guys very shortly in the very next lecture.
