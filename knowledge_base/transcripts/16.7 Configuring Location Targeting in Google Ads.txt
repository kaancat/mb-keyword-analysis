# 16.7 Configuring Location Targeting in Google Ads

How do Google ads fans and welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to configure location settings as we're creating our very first Googleads campaign using some of the principles and strategies we spoke about in the very previous lecture.So let's jump back into the computer here.We have again back at our Google Ads introductory page where we're creating our first campaign.We know we have a search campaign, our campaign name.We talked about networks and over here we could choose location targeting by default.Google selects the entire United States, which is fine, fantastic.But let's say we want to now configure specific location targeting.So I'm going to select enter another location.And I don't have to go into what's advanced search necessarily.I can just start typing in a location, I could start, I could type in an address, I could type ina town.So I'm going to start typing in New York City and I have a bunch of options.Google is going to populate a bunch of different options.So I could do New York, the New York, United States, the entire New York, New York, which is probablyreferring to just Manhattan and all those different sorts of locations.Now I have the option to target, exclude or select nearby.If I want to target New York and only target New York, then I would select Target if I want to targetthe entire world.Because now that I've selected choose locations, if I just exclude New York, then I'm going to betargeting worldwide, just excluding New York.If I click Exclude, you'll see that I'm targeting all countries and territories and I'm excluding NewYork, so I'm going to remove that and remove the New York target.I could also enter in a specific address.Let's say I just start typing in Cherry Lane, and there it is, North Carolina, United States.There must be a Cherry Lane near there.And I could also enter in specific addresses to target or exclude, say I'm going to target a town inLong Island, my hometown, Huntington.I see that there's Huntington Beach, California, but I could scroll down and find Huntington, NewYork, with a reach of 94,000 people.That's an estimated reach for the amount of eligible people that would potentially be involved in thiscampaign, not necessarily based on your keywords.Again, it's not 94,000 people based on looking for office chairs.It's just the total amount of people that Google estimates to be in that location.And I could target, exclude or click nearby.Let's say I click target.Great.Now what if I want to go in and use some more of the advanced location configuration settings?So I'm going to go to advanced search.And now I have the option to do a few different things under the location settings option.I could add locations in bulk and I could paste in a list of zip codes.And this is really helpful in to to for two reasons.One is if you're looking at your historic data and you see that there are certain zip codes or certaincities that are performing better, you might want to specifically target all those places because youcan then adjust the bids or decrease the bids based on your your your performance history.I'm going to show you how you could find that in Google ads.You could also target specific zip codes, locations, countries, etc. It's a very useful tool thatwe use a lot.The second technique that I would highly recommend is for a lot of your businesses.A lot of you guys, if you're in ecommerce, you might be targeting the entire United States.I highly recommend splitting up all 50 United States, all 50 of the states, adding them in bulk,and then you're targeting all the states.It's the same in concept.It's the same as if you would have just left the target, the United target, the entire United Statesoption checked in the previous step.But if you upload and you specifically target all 50 states, that will give you the ability off thebat to modify your bids at the state level.So you might want to get more aggressive or more conservative, depending on your goals, dependingon your data.The map area is also pretty cool.I could zoom in and zoom out of the map and I could see what locations shaded in blue that I have targeted.So let's say I'm going to exclude Amityville.I'm going to start I'm not going to go in bulk, but I'm going to search for Amityville.And I see that I could exclude Amityville.And we'll see now in red on the map that I'm excluding that location.So if I scroll out a little bit, I'll see I have a blue targeting blue area and excluding the red areas.I'm going to remove these for now and I'm going to just type in, let's say, United States, the entirecountry, 285 million people estimated.And great, I see that on the map.Now that it's targeted, I could exclude locations within my targeted location.Right.So I could target the United States and I could take out, let's say, Arizona if we don't ship to Arizona.Right.And I could exclude Arizona.So now I have the United States being targeted, but Arizona being excluded.And even though they're overlapping, the exclusion is the one that will be favored.So if you're including Arizona through your inclusion of the United States, but you're excluding Arizonathrough your specific exclusion of that state on the state level, your ads will not show up to peoplein Arizona.It's an important thing to remember.Let's now go into radius targeting and see how that might work.With radius targeting.Remember, we could either use pin mode or we could just start typing the name of an address.And remember we spoke about how with your competitors, this would be a really, really cool thing todo.So if I start typing in the location of our business, 1157 Broadway Hewlett I'm going to see that.I'm going to click Target.Remember, you could only Target with radius targeting.I'm going to remove the United States so we could get a clearer picture.So now I have a 20 mile radius around our office location and it includes Manhattan.But let's say I'm running a campaign.I wanted to be much more local, Sam, running a campaign for recruiting purposes.And we don't want to go so far out.We don't think people will travel as much.We want to get more local people.So I could just go ahead and let's say choose five miles and re enter my address that I entered before.Target that and I'll see a smaller circle and I can remove the 20 mile targeting and I'll just be leftwith that smaller five mile radius.Remove that, remove my Arizona.And then I could also use pin mode.So I go ahead and click pin mode.I could scroll out and drag around the map and I could go into a specific area if I find my addressor I find a competitor's address or I know of an area that I want to target, I could just literallyclick and drop that pin on the map and I have my five mile target if I want to do something with andI have to click Target.If I want to do a greater mile radius, let's say I want to do 200 miles around a certain location,right?So then I can stay in pin mode.I don't need to type in an address.I can zoom out a bit and I could find an area that I want to target 200 miles around, let's say Columbus,Ohio.I click Target and if I zoom out, I'll see my 20 mile target and my five mile target up there.You have to get really deep in to see that five mile target and it's right over there.So pin mode for radius targeting is really cool.Remember, you could only target the radius target you.Unfortunately, you can't exclude locations.The radius targeting.It's a it's kind of annoying.It's kind of a pain.But that's how you configure and set up location targeting and Google ads.Remember that when you're targeting the Unite the entire United States, it's really a good idea.It's great.Best practice to add in all 50 states at once from the outset, from when you begin your campaign,that will give you much greater flexibility and much greater ease as you're optimizing your campaigns,because you could increase and decrease the bids and budget at the location level.And I'm going to show you how to do that in the very next lecture.Also, remember that you could go back and change your location settings at any single time in a campaign.I could add locations, I could remove locations, I could change my targeting and exclusion settings,which we'll cover in two lectures from now.There's a lot you could do.You could always come back and make those changes at any time.So if it's not perfect now, don't necessarily overthink it.So let's say just for pop and we'll put in something by default, let's say we're going to say fourpop in, we're going to ship to the United States and I'm going to target.But we don't ship to we don't ship to New York.We don't ship office shares, let's say, to New York.So we'll exclude New York and we don't ship them to California, not because we don't ship them becausewe know that our campaigns have been too expensive in California, let's say, and that's a good wayto do it.Another really great idea, if you're a local business or if you have multiple showrooms, we have awe have a client down in Florida that has four or five high end Italian furniture showrooms.And we have campaigns targeting just a three or four mile radius right around their locations.And we're extremely aggressive with the bids for people who are looking for showrooms, Italian furniture,because even if people are looking for information online, we could sometimes get them to go into ashowroom if they're close enough.But if we're just targeting a a national campaign, that wouldn't work because people who are, let'ssay, higher in the funnel are never going to see or come to our showroom.So using your specific business dynamics, do you have brick and mortar locations?Where do you ship to?Where have you been finding the most profits?Those are the types of things you want to start thinking about as you configure your location settings.And lastly, but certainly not least remember that location targeting is not black and white.It's not either I'm in that location or I'm not in that location.I could modify my bid.So a $5 bid on a keyword in New York, you don't have to exclude Arizona.If Arizona or another location is not performing as well, I could just modify my bid.I could put a -50% bid adjustment, and now that bid will be a maximum of $2.50.I could put a 100% bid increase.So that $5 bid will now be a $10 bid.Right.All sorts of things like that.So it's not black and white.There's a lot of grey area when it comes to location targeting.And when you start using location targeting in that way, that's when you'll be a lot more successfulwith your Google ads and you'll see your your budget being spent that much more efficiently.So now that you know how to set up location targeting, I'm going to show you in the next lecture howto pull up location reports in Google ads.And after that, we'll get into targeting and exclusion settings, which is exciting stuff.Cheers from now and I'll see you guys very soon in the very next lecture.
