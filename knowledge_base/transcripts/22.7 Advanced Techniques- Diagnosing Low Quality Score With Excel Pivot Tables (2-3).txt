# 22.7 Advanced Techniques- Diagnosing Low Quality Score With Excel Pivot Tables (2-3)

OK.And that's a little bit more accurate.It was my mistake.Obviously I realize that those numbers are way too low.So with this is you know exactly much more in line with what we want.I'm going to right click click Format Cells again get in our 1000 separator zero decimal places.And now we have a clear and more readable.So we have two hundred ninety seven thousand clicks.And for example keywords with the qualities Gorp 8 we have a hundred and nine thousand clicks with 1.7million impressions.OK.And that's a very cool way to start seeing what's going on below.We want to do.Which will give us a clearer and simpler sensors get the percentage of impressions for each qualis courseand to do that we're going to create our own custom formula.So we'll name it Quality Score percentage and we'll create a formula so equals someof these some of the impressions which is C4 divided by Dollar Sign see dollar sign 14 which is thetotal number of impressions that we the reason we do the dollar sign is to create an absolute valuewhich will allow us to drag this formula down to the bottom so we do the sum of impressions pro-qualityscore divided by the total number of impressions.Now give us the percentage of impressions going to go ahead click enter and drag that down to the.To all our quality scores.And I want to format this as a percentage which I could easily do here or I would also just format thecells.That's another easy way to do it.I could add decimal points remove decimal points with these handy shortcuts if you're not seeing thesehandy shortcuts then you just want to format the cells once to get by right clicking on the column orclicking command one on a Mac.So now I see the percentage.So this is going to give us a very clear overall health check over our cap.So if I if I take a look at all the the percentage of of keywords or the percentage of impressions undera quality score of 7 you get a sum of sixty five point six five percent and that tells us that we definitelyneed to do some major work in this account.So almost 66 percent of our impressions have come from keywords that have a less than 7 quality scorein a healthy account.We want to see a 65 to 70 percent of impressions above 7 or 7 or above and if we highlight this we seewe're only getting 35 percent above 7 or 7 or above.So that's we definitely know that we need some help in this account by creating this very simple andeasy to use and easy to manipulate pivot table.But there's one thing that's missing here.We don't know exactly where in our account these qualities or issues exist.We just know overall right now our account is not so healthy.We're getting 66 percent of our impressions are below quality score of 7 but which add groups whichadd groups in our account do we need to start working on right away.So let's take a look at how to do that.So let's go back to our data sheet of all key words and let's create a new pivot table someone to goover to insert once more and create a new pivot table from scratch.And I'm going name this at group level pivot because we're in Analyze group in this section.So I'm going to first go ahead and add add group as our roll label and we want to take the some of cost.We want to see the high spending add groups.So I'm going to go ahead and find my cost column and I could drag this down to make it a little easier.Go ahead and find my cost column and added to my values and I want to do some of cost when I can makethat mistake again.So some of cost.And we want to take our quali score and find an average quality of course we're going about a qualityscore but we don't want count of quality score.We want average quality score in the ad group itself so we can go instead of going to summer camp whereyou go to average.And we want definitely change those decimal places down a little bit.So once again format cells number and just two decimal places.OK.So on average we have an average quality score.And we have our some of cost of here and let me zoom in to make this easier to see.OK.So now it should be easier to see.So here we can start taking a look at the high spending ad groups with low or or which we know wherethose quality scores are.So for example that's format the cells to include a commaOK.So for example here's a here's an ad group that spent $17000.Seventeen and a half thousand dollars with an average quality score of seven point four nine that'spretty good.Here's an Aggie that spent twenty two thousand dollars with an average qualis wharfs six point to eight.This is a menagerie that we definitely do some work in six point to eight but there happens to be anotherissue.The problem with this view of quality score is that average is a lie.It's not a weighted average it's just a straight average of these amps.So how are we going to change and create a weighted average for quality score before we do that.Let's take a look and just understand exactly what I mean when I say average is like let's create anew sheet to call this one averages lie.And let's create a couple some sample data.So let's say here we have keywords impressions and quality score and we have a key word which is bakecakes on line and line cake courses.OK.So those are two key words just in this quick example.Let's say this key word hastwenty thousand impressions.This keyword has five impressions.This key word has a quality score of hmm.Let's give this key word a quality score of four.And this key word a quality score of 10.OK.So in actuality our average over here template for divided by two is seven.So our average quality score for this group is a seven.But in fact our weighted average based on the volume of impressions for that quad is course probablysomething more like a four point 0 1 4 point 0 2 very close to 4 because the four was or has so manymore impressions then the key with a 10 quads score.So it's not really accurate to say that this group is doing well with a 7.It's much more accurate to say that this average this this ad group is doing poorly with the keywordof you know with an average qualis with a weighted or normalized quality score.Just a tad or four.So I hope that helps make sense.And now is it actually a cool way and it's in English.Brad Getty's from certified knowledge walked us through in one of his videos showing how to normalizequality score to get the weighted average and it's very straightforward simple thing to do.So to do that let's go back to all our keywords and we're going to add a new column and we're goingto call this column quality score times impressions.OK.So quality or time compression quality or times multiply by impressions give me the name of this column.OK so over here we want to do is a very simple form.So we're going to do equals someof our quali score.So we're going to find our colleague in her column right here so it's G-3.Just go ahead and click G-3 and times impressions I see over here it's I threeG-3 multiplied by three and enter.And we're going to drag this down to the bottom.OK so now we have our quality score times impressions column.Now we want to do is we want to create a new pivot table.So I'm going to select all my columns at once and more.OK.And you don't necessarily have to do it this way.You could always just simply go back and and refresh the data in your in your average level pivot.But let's do it again.And this way you could watch me build it again in case you missed something the first time.So go ahead and select my data include my new column and go to insert.Create a Pivot Table click OK I'm going to name this pivot table pivot table weighted and that's goahead and rebuild our data.So if you remember we had ADD group under row.OK.We had costto determine those high cost campaigns.OK.So we had some of cost.We want to get the average quality score.So we go to we add drag qualis score click quality score drag into the values and want to do an averagequality score.OK.And once again we could reformat this to just include you know two decimals that say make it easierto read.Let's zoom in here.Nice and big.OK.So now we have our our AD group the high spending at groups over here and we have the average qualityscore.We want to go ahead and actually add the because we made before we just quantised score times impressions.So I'll go into my pivot table builder and I'll drag my new column in which is at the bottom in thisquad is four times impressions.And instead of Count I want to change that to some.OK so now I have some of the impressions and I also want to add.I have.I'm sorry I have some of qualis four times impressions I also want to add my total sum of impressionsor just my regular impressions value drag that down and make sure I add make sure I create a sum ofimpressions.OK so now I have my new column and some of impressions and I can go ahead and make that with a commaseparatorwith no decimal places.Same thing here just to make it easier to read.
