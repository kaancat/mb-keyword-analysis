# 21.2 Importing Your Keyword Lists From Excel Into Your New Ad Group

Price as a qualifier in the role in the headline of our AD So let's see what we can if we can figureout.So I tried rolling office chairs from 350 and that is too long as you see our headline only has 25 charactersand we went over by six characters.We need to modify this.We can take out chairs and we I'm sorry we take out the word office and we'll probably be OK.But I like the word office because that indicates that this is specifically toward you know cateringtowards office use which is what our company does cater to.So let's see what we could do to narrow this down.So rolling office chairs we could maybe change office to desk to get a few less categories less wordsand or less characters and now we're only negative for rolling desk chairs.350.That's not bad.I'm not.You know I'm not against this even though we don't need to we don't necessarily have to say from 350people who get the idea that we're not only selling one price that's you know something which is intuitive.The point of the 350 would be want to.We want to dissuade people who are looking for really cheap chairs from clicking on our AD.So I like this for not rolling gestures 350 is a very clear succinct.And it's it's it's it's very to the point our first line of description once again we want to talk aboutfeatures we want to talk about features benefits and like we said it's always good for benefits to comefirst.In most cases benefits can come first and that's why we had our initial ad was working full your bestfrom $350 and we want to talk about the benefits of having rolling vesture.So part of why people want our rolling desk chair or a desk chair on wheels is for the ease and convenienceof moving around.We want to be able to put that or convey that somehow in our first line of description.So let's think about how we could do that.So.So I like this and it turns out that it fits perfectly.Wheels that work as fast as you do.So it's it's a feature or a benefit rather that conveys that these are high quality wheels.It conveys that these wheels won't fail and it also conveys that it's about work it's about gettingmore work done.It's about working with more pleasure.So wheels that work as fast as you do.It's it's it's kind of developing and conveying some of our personalities some of our brand personalityinto the text at the.I really like that so that's a great description line number one.And it's nice for relevancy because wheels is very similar to rolling.And Google will pick up on that Google will pick up that wheels and rolling are from the same themeand will will we will be able to increase our quality score and you might not know quality score isjust yet but we're going to have a very in-depth look at quality score in a couple of videos.So I think we can leave our description line to the same because this is talking about features.So free shipping and handling 10 year warranty and our call to action shop now.I really like this description line too because once again we were able to include three distinct elements.Two of them were distinct features which just free shipping and handling and our 10 year warranty andthe third element is a very clear call to action shop now.And like you see we have one exclamation point or display you RL is like we spoke about what the usersees in the ads so if you see over here in our ad preview section the display or L is so it shows upunderneath our headline and like we said if you remember all we need to do for the display you are wellis make sure our root domain pop in dot com is the same but we could create any extension that we want.So for the sake of relevancy to the user and both to Google we want to add in our key word here.So rolling desk chairs is perfect.It fits.It's going to score points with Google's algorithms to increase our relevancy score.It's also going to be more relevant to the user.Looks like the coming right to the rolling desk chairs page even though that pop'n themselves don'thave.That does not have a separate page just ruling gestures.If we jump over the popguns web site I go back to furniture desk chairsand they actually do have a Peytral industrious I'm sorry.Click on the sub page.And here we have the page we want to send them to which is all there.You know all their rolling gestures and they do have further subcategories of rolling but we want tosend them to the page that has a wide variety and a selection of rolling gestures because they did notspecify in their query anything other than this is what they want.So we go here and we'll copy that you Arel bring it back to add words and paste it into our final UR L section.And here's the final Lorelle that somebody will land on.So that's a really good thing to do.Also it in sending people to the right page that answers their question the most direct and succinctway will also score points in Google's algorithms because when Google reads the URL of this page andthey read the content they'll see that it talks a lot about rolling desk chairs.And that's going to match up with the keywords in our AD group for all and gestures and we want to sendpeople who are looking.Who's it people specifically told us they're looking for role and gestures What better page to sendthem to than the page on the Web site that actually talks and actually sells are rolling gestures.So we're really good with our ad right now.You are ready for mobile.You can leave that blank unless your deciding to direct traffic to a specific mobile you RL.Today most Web sites are mobile responsive and the mobile you or els will be the same as the final orelse so you can definitely just leave that blank.Also add your real options which is attracting templating custom parameters.We'll talk about Google auto tagging and what the use of custom parameters are in a later chapter.For now and in most cases you're going to just need leave that blank you don't need to touch that.And now we have the ability to go ahead and add our keywords and easy for us.And because we did a good amount of work before we could just go head over into Excel and grab our keyboards.So let's go back to XO.And now we want to filter out just our rolling keywords.OK so we'll just go we since we already selected the filter function in the previous chapter on it todo is click on this little filter icon in the ad group and de-select all and just go down and selectrolling which is down here.OK.So here we have rolling.I could clear out of the filter and now I have just my rolling keywords.So the first thing I want to do is I could take my phrase and exact match version of my keywords soI'll just copy down here is my phrase and exact match and I'll do a copy function back to afterwardsand simply paste.OK.And here I have all my keywords my phrase matched keywords that Google might be reading.My single parentheses as single parentheses are not asked for not as quotation marks.So I have to go here and just change the single parentheses into quotations and you could actually dothis afterwards by by a find and replace function which I'll show you how to use.But since this is not a tremendous amount of keywords it just takes a second.I could just do that by hand.So here I have my phrase an exact rescuer's.Don't worry if there's spaces Google's going to fix that up for us when once we save them.Now we want to get our broad match modified versions of these keywords called back to excel again.And what we need to do is here create a nother filter because we still have the broad without the plussigns where we had to phrase an exact match.Remember we had moved them over so we could just create another simple filter.And this is a cool trick to know also in Excel.I want to filter everything that includes a plus sign.So I'll de-select all and I'll choose.Over here in this in this dropdown menu contains an output in my plus sign and I'll click exit and I'llbe able to just copy these over here come and copy back to add words and command B to paste.So here I have all my rolling modified cuarto I have the phrase match version of rolling office seedingwith an office chair and desk seating and desk chair and they're all in that.They each have a match modified version of an exact match and a freeze match version.And my default bid like we said this is the default add group bid.And we'll just make it three dollars.We'll be able to go ahead and change the key with level bids later and we'll be able to click Set upbilling later because we're going to set up billing later we're is going to save this agrah for nowand click Set up billing later and we will have our beautiful new group called rolling.OK.And don't worry about this morning we says low search volume We'll talk about what that means and howit works a little bit later.OK.So now we want to go ahead and repeat this process for the other Agard.So let's go ahead and do another one by hand and just start getting the hang of it.Once again remember we have to go back to our campaign brings us back to the AD group tab.Create a new ad group and this time we're going to create our next keywords so let's just clear thefilters or we here clear filter.OK.And the next one and do is modern.OK.So we'll be able to do another filter for Modern go back up to the top de-select all find modern.OK.Take our phrase.Viewersgo back to add words and write the ad in a minute.But you could also just add the keywords.First that's also fine paste my key words in fix my quotation marks.
