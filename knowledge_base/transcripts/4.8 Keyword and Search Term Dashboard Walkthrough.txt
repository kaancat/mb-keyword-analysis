# 4.8 Keyword and Search Term Dashboard Walkthrough

Welcome back.In this lesson we're going to do an example walkthrough of negative keywords built out inside of a campaignwith multiple ad groups.So here we have a search query at the top the search query.Somebody goes to Google and types in bike bikes for kids under $125.That is our search query.That's what the person that's what the user typed into Google.Now we're an advertiser and we sell bikes.So we have a campaign.The campaign is a campaign for bikes.We have four different ad groups.We have an ad group targeting adult bikes.We have an ad group targeting kids bikes.We have an ad group targeting electric bikes and an ad group targeting mountain bikes.Now let's look at the kids bikes ad group.So the keyword, some of the keywords in that ad group might be bikes for kids phrase match, bikesfor girls and bikes for boys.Those are the keywords that we want Google to use to match up with a relevant search query.In the adult bike we have adult bikes, bikes for men, bikes for women, broad, and in the mountainbikes ad group we have mountain bike phrase match and mountain bike broad match.Now It's worth remembering that in the mountain bike keyword example, bikes for kids under $125 mightbe a search query that does trigger that keyword for mountain bike.If we look at the the negative keywords inside the mountain bikes ad group.We'll see over here boys, girls, kids as negative keywords.Now that doesn't mean we don't want the word kids in a query to not trigger any of our ads.We just want the word kids to trigger an ad in the Kids Bikes ad group.So the negative keywords in the kids bike ad group would be adult men, women, electric mountain.Okay, so this is the a general structure.So as a discussion point, pause the video.Um, what's right with this example and what's wrong with this example based on everything that we'velearned.Look through the negative keywords.Look through the sample keywords, look through the structure of the ad groups, and see if you couldpoint out something that is good, and see if you could point out something that could be better.I'm not going to say what I think.Um, but you can certainly interact and make comment post comments in the discussion forum.I'd be very interested to hear what you come back with and how you might restructure some of these keywords,ad groups, or negative keywords inside this campaign.But again, these are this is an example of negative keyword sculpting, where the negative keywordsthat are all applied to the ad group levels or all keywords that we would want to trigger an ad for.We just want to make sure that Google looks for the right ad group and triggers the right ad.So for example, in the Kids Bikes ad group, we're going to have ad copy that talks about kids bikes.And the landing page for that ad is going to send people to a page on a website that talks primarilyabout kids bikes.So we want to make sure that any time somebody searches, anytime the word kids or children appearsin a search query, Google shows the ads that we wrote for the Kids Bikes ad group, because that'sgoing to be the most relevant experience for that user.Now we're going to, uh, talk about audience targeting.Get ready to learn about audience targeting and remember audience targeting.Just like negative keyword lists and negative keywords can be applied at the campaign or the ad grouplevel.Uh, that's it for this lesson, and I will see you shortly in the next lesson.
