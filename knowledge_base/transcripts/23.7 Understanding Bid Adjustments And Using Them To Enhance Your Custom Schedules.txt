# 23.7 Understanding Bid Adjustments And Using Them To Enhance Your Custom Schedules

Throughout most of the different days except for late Wednesday afternoon and this is also an interestingand unique schedule and it's based on what we found in the data.So as you're seeing and as you start learning more about your business and how your clicks come in andhow you start spending money and advertising you're going to be able to really start spending moneyin a more thoughtful way by creating more thoughtful adjustments.And if you see over here under the convergence column Our client has a lot of conversions.You know the bulk of their conversions coming out coming in on Friday.So what I'm actually going to do right now is is make a little bit more of a of an aggressive bid adjustmenton Friday because I'm seeing an average cost per click of 4000 40 cents.And I happened to know with an average cost conversion of $79 that this is highly profitable for ourclient.I wouldn't recommend you go ahead and make these big adjustments just because you see a lot of conversionson one day you want to know that your your bids are profitable and that your clicks are turning intoprofitable conversions that you're making more money than you're spending.We didn't cover how to do that yet.But developing a profitable bidding strategy and understanding your return on investment is somethingwe're going to cover in a later chapter coming up.But just to go ahead and give you a sense of how to do this I'm going to click on this plus 55 percentand change that to plus 70 percent because I I'd like to make that a little bit more aggressive.Okay.So click save.And that's how it's going to that's going to look.Now that plus 80 percent adjustment and that will be also reflected appear on Friday plus 70 percentthat adjustment.I could also extend Friday to go to 6 o'clock.And by doing that I just click as schedule go into Friday and change Friday to 6 p.m. and I'm also goingto make Friday starting at 6:00 a.m. and I can also make it you know I'll decide to go to 6:30 he goesthe the hours can be changed in 15 minute increments.I go to 6:30 click save and I made some changes that I think are going to help our campaign grow.And you know we'll see what happens we'll take it from there.That's essentially what Scott Kusum scheduling looks like.Now you might be asking where do I see in my count the data for clicks coming in at different hoursof the day.Because that's how you figure out where you should set up because of schedules and how you can optimize.And that's a great question.The way you do that is what we call the dimensions tab.OK.So I'm going to just change the date range to get some more data Goward.The last I'd say three months or so.And obviously you see my my charts change but the dimensions tab is in the we're going to cover in alittle more detail coming up.But just to show you exactly where to find this information you click on dimensions and now I have mymentions tab the dimensions tab breakdown your data in in a in a customizable way that lets you seeall your important KPI is based on different parameters so your parameter is the most left column overhere.So we hear it's called day.And all my cousins keep your eyes are on these right columns clicks is a KPI key performance indicatorimpressions.Could the rate average CPC conversions and so on and so forth.So I could choose and edit the way I break down my parameters in this view dropdown.So we here are sewing the day over the last you or my date range which is around 3 months from showingthe data for each day.Now let's say I want to see the data for our of the week for our of the day so I go to View.I search and I find time and now under time I have a few different options I could search so I couldsee by day of the week day week month quarter year and hour of the day.So let's first take a look at day of the week.I want to get a sense of how these campaigns are doing broken down by day of the week.So here I have a very nice clean graph I see Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday and I wantto see what my key performance indicator is of choice what do I want to be optimizing for.So you might want to optimize for cost per conversion.You might want to look at conversions is a whole bunch different things are going to look at based onhow your company makes money.So let's take a look at cost per conversion and I sort by selecting clicking on the header title sosee Tuesday has my most expensive cost of conversion and it's pretty significant.So I might want to drop my make a little bit of a less aggressive bid on Tuesday.And what's interesting is that we're not really seeing more expensive clicks on Tuesday.You know four dollars and seventy six cents is pretty stable with other days of the week.But we're seeing a much more expensive cost per click so that's showing me that people are not generallybuying as much on Tuesday as they do on other days of the week.If we scroll down here we see that the cheapest cost per conversion comes on Friday which is 26 conversionswhich is also the most conversions.Once you get proficient at Excel downloading this data into Excel will be very helpful.Once again you know that you can download the data by clicking this big download button over here nextto that view changed history.This is a really powerful and helpful way for us to see where we should start setting up custom schedulesso just as information alone told us we should have a little bit less aggressive bid on Tuesday andmore aggressive bids on Friday because Friday is our best day.Now take a look at our of the day so we can go to View time hour of the day so this will show us showus all the days you know in conjunction with them each other we're not broken down by day anymore receivethe data for all days of the week.And now we're seeing the hour of the day.So if I want to see my kids now it's showing me my columns sort of by cost converge conversion the mostexpensive cost per conversion.OK.So $272 conversion I know is not good for my client they're losing money on that.And that's coming from noon.So we see that noon hour 12 the day is no good for us.We're showing just a few conversions and a very very expensive cost of conversion.So it's lunchtime.People might be browsing.People are not buying as much.OK.If we take a look at eight o'clock on them at 10:00 in the morning.OK.So 10:00 a.m. We're showing 20 conversions at $175 a conversion that's much better.So we're seeing a lot of conversions at 10:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. 11:00 a.m. 8 a.m. So 7:00 a.m. So we seeover here seven to you know just about 10:00 in the morning is our sweet spot.That's where we're getting most of our business.So I'd want to go ahead and create a a big adjustment a positive bitted that just in from from sevento you know around 10:00 in the morning.So it's go ahead and do that right now.Song and go to settings back in this campaign and go to.And this is keep in mind guys this is a live account is an account that spending many thousands of dollarsa month.I think this account spends around around you know 15 to 20000 jobs a month.So these are important and real changes we're making and I'm showing you the actual things that I woulddo and that I actually do do to improve the performance of the client account.So I go backward to ad schedule and I'm going to create new schedules that what we have Thursday TuesdayMonday Wednesday 7:00 a.m. to noon ready plus five.Let's see what we can do.So I'm going to do is go over to my custom as schedule.I'm going to make a new day for Monday because Monday only a 4:53 so I'll make this Monday 7:00 a.m.until noon and this Monday will become noon to 5:00.We'll add one for Tuesday do the same thing.Tuesday will become 7:00 a.m. to noon and this Tuesday will become noon to 5:00.We already have a Wednesday 7:00 a.m. to noon.And Wednesday should go till 5 am.We need one for Thursday.Thursday we'll have one from 7:00 a.m. to noon and this Thursday will become noon 5:00 and Friday wehave a 5:54 are going to keep that as one big puzzle adjustment click save.We're getting some time periods overlap.Thursday 7:00 a.m..It should be 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. rather it should be 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. 4 p.m. Wednesday 12:00p.m..This one should be till 12 p.m.should be 7:00 a.m..So now we have 7 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. rather.This is OK.And then 12 p.m.to 5 p.m. and Thursday OK.So this should be fine.Now just keep in mind that time here is can out of our laps.This should work OK.It did.And now we can go ahead and create our more thoughtful budget estimates that we wanted to create them.So we're running ads just to make sure that we have everything clear here.11:53 11:53and 4:48.And we have Friday all day 6 to 6 at 6:30.So I want to select all my seven to noon days.So we already have and it's like 7:21 here Monday 7:00 a.m. to noon Tuesday 7:00 a.m. to noon Thursday7:00 a.m. to noon and Friday.OK.So I want to now Krita said I want to set my bit adjustment for these days so I don't increase it by65 percent and I'd be pretty aggressive at that.And now we have if we look over here all the days of the week that we're running have a a positive 65percent adjustment for the hours that we saw on our dimensions tab that we're the most profitable thatbrought in the most amount of conversions.Basically what I'm saying is I see that we're profitable or very profitable during these certain timesthat day and I want to be more aggressive.I want to get higher positions I want to shop for more ads.I want to spend more my budget during those hours that are bringing us the most conversions so I canyou know really really cool I can go ahead and and capitalize on those market trends by creating thesecustom schedules like we saw right here in this account.So that's really had a great Kusum schedules you know how to get to them.We could go ahead and create these.Keep in mind that this custom schedules only created for one campaign if I want to create the same schedulefor other campaigns I can.But you want to go look at your data first.You want to make sure you're creating these custom schedules with thought and with and with researchand with understanding.So you go over to the dimensions Dabi take a look at your view time by hour of the day and day of theweek and you start getting a sense of where your campaigns are succeeding and where they're strugglingand that information will allow you to go and create some very profitable and very useful custom schedules.And this is the type of thing that's going to really give you an edge over your competition.OK so Cousin scheduling is extremely important.I would say 98 percent of accounts should be using custom schedules in some capacity or another.They're really really important.They're really cool they really are effective and they really do make a huge difference.So keep that in mind and play around with your cousins schedules and really understand how to use themeffectively and how to set them up how to edit them how to change them and how to create those reallyimportant bit adjustments.So guys thank you very much for watching this one.We'll see you in just a couple of seconds.Right ahead in the next chapter in this course talk to you guys from
