# 8.1 How to Analyze the Insights Reports to Understand Competition

Like we discussed, it's important to analyze the auction Insights report to understand your competition.So here is a screenshot of the Google Ads dashboard under the Auction Insights report.And you find the Auction Insights report by going to Insights Reports in the left hand menu and thetab or the menu item below.Insights is what's called Auction Insights, and that's where you're going to get to see your competitorsand how your competitors perform in relationship to you.So the metrics you're going to be able to see in the Auction Insights report is the impression share.So the percentage of available impressions that you are showing up for and the the percentage of availableimpressions that your competitors are showing up for.Number two is the overlap rate.What percentage of searches are you overlapping with that competitor?So if you see a competitor that has a 95% overlap rate, then what's likely is this is a real competitor.These two accounts have very similar account setups.Now, if you see a 95 or an 85% overlap rate with a brand that is not competitive to you, then eitherone of you two have a mismanaged account, right?If you're showing up with if you're if 80% of the times you're winning an auction, you're also nextto or you're winning an auction with a certain brand that does not sell the things that you sell oris extremely different or caters to a different audience.You can't do anything about their account, but you should probably look and try to reevaluate yourown account.Make sure you're bidding on the right keywords and the right audiences.Position above rate.What?What percentage of impressions are you above a specific competitor?Top of page rate.What percentage of impressions are you at the top of the page in relationship to the competitors, andyou'll be able to see the top of page rate for these other competitors.That will give you a sense of how aggressively certain competitors are bidding absolute top of pagerate.That means the very number one spot.So top of page means the 3 or 4 search results above the organic results.Absolute top of page is the number one spot.I agree it's a pretty bad name for the number one spot.Why can't they just call it the number one spot?But okay.And outranking share.What percentage of impressions, um, are you outranking the other competitors in the auction with you?Um, so, for example, if you have an outranking share of if, if if a brand in the if a brand in thedomain column.So let's say, uh, take your sunglass store is called Sam's Shades.And um, and the competitor is toms tortoiseshell.And you see a, you see toms tortoiseshell has a 30% outranking share.That means in 30% of the auctions that you, Sam Shades and Toms tortoiseshell show up together 30%of the time.Toms tortoise shells are above you.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about the supply and demand curve and how supply and demandrelates to competitiveness.
