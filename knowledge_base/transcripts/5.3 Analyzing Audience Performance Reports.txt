# 5.3 Analyzing Audience Performance Reports

Welcome back.We're going to talk about how to analyze the audience performance reports.So if we go into the dashboard we navigate to the audiences tab.We're going to see what it looks like a standard Google Ads report on the left under the audience segment.Those are going to be the names of the actual audiences that you've selected.And if you look at the targeting setting, this is what's really important.You'll see that all of these are set to observation.And remember from visitors.We have visitors in the past 120 days Mother's day, dining, home furnishings, home and garden.ET cetera.ET cetera.We're not actively targeting or excluding these audiences.We're just observing in this account in particular, which has in this date range, this 30 days, $335,000of conversion value.We're just observing whether these audiences are performing differently.So we might see differences in click through rates.We might see differences in conversion rates.And if you look down the list over here at the bottom we see total segments.So total segments is how this entire, um, how this entire all of these segments together, all ofthese audience segments together performed against total other everything else in the everything elsein the campaign.So if you look at conversion rate all the way down, we see the overall all the other campaigns thatare all the other activity, all the other clicks that are not included in any of these segments havea combined conversion rate conversion rate of 5.6%.But if we look at the conversion rate from these segments, it's a 7.5%, uh, percent conversion rate.So we see through this observation, we have a tremendous insight.People coming through these audience segments have a higher than average conversion rate.And there's certainly enough data we're talking about here 10,000 clicks with 32,000 impressions.Um, we're seeing a tremendous, tremendously improved engagement rate from these audience segments.Now, if we look up and down this column, there'll be variances in that conversion rate.So we have from 6.8% in book to the in the book lovers audience, all the way to a 9.2% visitors past120 days, which makes sense.Um and luxury Missouri travelers 6.6% 7% for home decor.So there's some variance there.But the key headline is not the individual variance.In this example.The key headline is that all of these segments combined are generating a significantly better conversionrate than the rest of the account.And with click through rate, we see this even more significantly.We have an 18% click through rate for all other impressions and clicks in the account that are not partof any of these audience segments, compared to a whopping 30% click through rate for audience for audiencesin these in-market segments.So this is proof you could really see that some of these in-market segments, these affinity audiences,these these custom intent audiences, the customer list, the remarketing audiences, it really doesmatter.You really do see you really can see a dramatically higher interaction rate, conversion rate and overallvalue and return on ad spend when you use audience audiences correctly.And here's just a closer view of the targeting setting targeting setting in.In this example, we have these audience segments all set to targeting.So let's just review what that means.So for example if we have an all visitors 60 days apply to a campaign, that means we're telling Googleonly show my ads to people who have visited the site within the last 60 days.That's an important piece here.Um, we have targeting versus observation versus exclusion.And remember what exclusions are.Exclusions under excluded segments would be where you could see in the Google Ads UI the excluded segmentswhere you're telling Google that anybody on that list are people you do not want Google to show yourads to.So for example, here we have A.m.g.That just means Adventure Media Group.It's an audience that we named Site Visitor 30.That means it's our own naming convention.Anybody who visited the site within the last 30 days do not show any ads to, even if they do matchany of the targeted audience segments.So, for example, if somebody is in an affinity audience that we're targeting or it's they're in anin-market or a custom in-market segment that we're targeting, but they've been on our site in the last30 days, and they appear on this audience list as well.Google will not show them an ad.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about a few audience testing ideas.I hope you're enjoying this.We'll see you in the next lecture.
