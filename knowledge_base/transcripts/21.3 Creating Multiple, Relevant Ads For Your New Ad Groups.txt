# 21.3 Creating Multiple, Relevant Ads For Your New Ad Groups

And write my AD.So for modern We want to follow the same concepts we're going to name or add group modern.It's going to be a text ad and we can really just change this to modern modern despatchers startingat $350.And we also want to change our description line one because he wanted to focus on modern.So we want to start thinking about what when people are looking for modern.What are they looking for.They're looking for something refined.They're looking for something which is in style and they're looking for looks.They're looking for something that's going to that has a more more of an aesthetic as opposed to moreof a functionality.People looking for rolling gestures are looking for a specific function a specific product characteristic.Over here they're looking for something which is less tangible something which is more of an emotionalappeal something which is more based on perception.OK.So we want to talk about that somehow in the description line one ever at.So let's think of different ways we can do that.OK so this is this idea is going a little overt we could try something new.So this idea of chic cutting edge and modern chairs is a nice idea.We went over a little bit so we could continue to work this through and this is something which is verycommon.So when you're when you're dealing with just 35 character limit and you have a lot of different ideasand you want to see a lot in just those 35 characters you're going to have to go through a few timesto get the right line of text for the ad and it's OK because this process should take some time.This is an important process and you want to start really thinking about things and how you're goingto really appeal and stand out from the other ads on the page you want to be unique.You want to convey your person the personality of your brand.So I like this huge selection of stylish office chairs because it conveys two things.One is that we have more than just one we have a big selection of people like selection and we alsoconvey the idea that it's stylish and people who are using modern in their queery will also be attractedto the idea of stylish chairs.But we're five characters over so once again we could try a teaching office a desk huge election officedesk chairs.It's still three characters over.So huge selection of about stylish seating.So that works.And because we already wrote desk chairs and the headline huge selection of stylish seating could workbecause the real focus for these people who are looking at this ad is the idea that it's stylish andmodern.That's what we really want to cater to.And I like that.And I'm very happy with with where we're where we're at with this description line one I think it'llreally appeal well to our customers and description line to free shipping handling 10 year warrantyshop now that's still fine to leave.And once again remember the display.Well we could just change rolling to modern and we want to make sure that we're sending people to theright page on our website.So go back to popping a look at the desk chairs and all the pomp and chairs are pretty modern and becausesomeone is looking for modern desk chair we're not sure if he's looking for rolling or not rolling.Or you know Boise's or scoop close to us.I'm happy to send people to just this chair just just to this page that talks about all their desk chairs.That's the best page for these people looking for modern chairs.If there was a specific section that spoke about just modern chairs or their most modern chairs we wouldwant to send them to that page.But since that page does not exist we want to send those people to the page that gives them the widestvariety of office chairs and because all our chairs are modern.We're confident that that this will be a good place to send our traffic to as well as copy that youare well and select all and paste.And now we have our appropriate final you RL for office chairs and now we didn't we have not yet addedour Broadnax modifieds lessons go down here.Jump back into Excel do our same filter which is a.It contains the plus sign under our key words column and we just copy these back to you add words andpaste and we want to default Max CPC bit to the end the $3 and set up billing later and there we haveit OK let's just do one more together and just so you got the hang of it.And then I will go ahead and add the other ones real quick.So once again we're going to jump back to our campaigns tab once again at a new ad group.Go back to excel to find the name of our group and clearing our filters out clearing our filters outover here and we're up to colorful so colorful going to be a fun one so we need to filter out by color.OK.De-select all slick colorful.Grab our phrase match back into to words.Paste them.I go ahead now and add my bra match modified by doing that other filter which is contains the plus sign.Copy those back and to add words and paste those in quickly fix my predecease into my quotations.OK and I will go up and write my answer.This one is going to be called this Ackerson be called colorful.It's going be a text and we want to change this to colorful colorful gestures starting at 350 once againwe're perfect honor.We're perfect with our character limit huge selection of stylish seating.And we want to come up with a good description line that talks about the color of our chair SoOK so I like this chairs in every color of the rainbow.But we're where over one character so it's not going to work.So what can we do to have this effect but truncate it a little bit.That doesn't work.Also it's a little bit over our limit for characters.Never boring always fun.Full color also over our limit.Somehow we could do a hyphen instead of the period.Never boring.Always fun.Never boring always fun be colorful.That's a little bit too longso I like this idea also work is boring.Cherrie's don't have to be.I kind of like that idea has a good personality to it.A good feel to it but once again we're over our character limits and showing you that it's very frustratingsometimes trying to stay within that 35 character limit it is difficult but we've got to keep goingand we don't want to give up or us or you know let our creativity be limited but it's just a matterof spending the time and coming up with different ideas to convey some personality while being unique.There we go like I like this color and quality without compromise it shows a very firm view.It makes a very bold statement that we're not compromising on quality we're not compromising on color.This is top of the line stuff.And it also is going to score a lot of good relevancy points because we have color and colorful alreadyin the description line one in the headline.Once again we want to make our display URL colorful to match the keywords and we want to make sure we'resending people to the right page.I happen to already know that there's no specific page for color or colorful chairs and we want to onceagain some people to the office chairs page of the website which is going to be a perfect place to sendthem to.We have a keywords and can go ahead.At our default bit of $3 and click Set up billing later and we have our third group so if you see overhere we have colorful modern enrolling three different groups and I can navigate between those Aggersby clicking on the name of the group in the left hand panel.OK.Alternatively I can go back to my campaigns and I'll be in my view when I get to see my three groupsright here in my data section and I can go ahead and navigate to their individual keywords by clickingon that ad group.Now let me go ahead and add the rest of the keywords real quick and I'm sorry.I'll go ahead and the rest of the groups really quickly.I'll speak through them and we'll then catch up once we have our beautiful campaign built out with allof our troops that we have design and Excel so I can go ahead and dothis.Yesit's
