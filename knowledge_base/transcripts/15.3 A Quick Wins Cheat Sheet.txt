# 15.3 A Quick Wins Cheat Sheet

All right.Welcome back.This is going to be a quick one.But it's going to be a really important one because it's a quick wins cheat sheet for running an effectiveaudit.It's just a way of getting you started.I remember just this feeling of being overwhelmed when I was getting new accounts to audit.Back in the day, sometimes we were signing 2030 clients a month and there was just tons of audits tobe doing.These accounts sometimes were large, messy, disastrous.And now having this quick wins cheat sheet for an audit is very helpful to our entire account managementteam, and it's by no means a full, detailed guide to everything you want to look at in an audit.You're going to develop your own feel for an audit, but this is something that you can have open onthe screen next to your Google Ads dashboard.As you're doing an audit, you can print it out.It's a checklist.It's something to look through.And if you're feeling overwhelmed or you're feeling lost, or you're feeling like you're not able togenerate insights or figure out a direction for an account.It's a great thing to pull up and use as a reference check.So let's go quickly run through this quick wins cheat sheet for Google Ads.Number one conversion tracking.That's going to be analyzing whether the data quality is accurate.If conversion actions for all key events are set up.If you're tracking micro conversions like views of key pages, if the campaigns are optimizing for thecorrect conversion action, if you're getting a sense for the time lag, is the account too conservativeor is it too aggressive?If you're not, if you're getting only 20% of your conversions are coming in with 1 in 1 day or less,your account is to your account.Your account maybe is too aggressive.You're bidding on too many keywords and you're not getting enough of that direct response traffic.If 90% of your conversions are coming in on the first day, then your account is too conservative andyou're probably doing a lot of brand.Number two attribution settings.Take a look at the attribution settings for the campaigns.Is everything being reported in the last click attribution model?That's a problem.That's not going to be telling you the whole story.That's going to give you a platform to talk about different attribution models, and how analyzing datawith different attribution settings could impact decision making.Number three enhance conversion tracking.Do you have enhanced conversion tracking activated.That's going to allow you to to look at revenue tracking, profit tracking and get better informationinto Google, especially for e-commerce businesses.Number four consolidate campaigns.Is the campaign structure too large?Do you have too many ad groups?Do you only have 2 to 3 keywords in some ad groups?What are the areas where you can where you can consolidate campaigns and have a more organized, streamlinedaccount that will work better with the modern Google Ads approach?Number five on the flip side, segment campaigns more.Do you have a campaign with only one ad group?And that ad group has keywords that are spanning 4 or 5 different product categories, or 2 or 3 differentproduct categories.That's an opportunity to segment out keywords into multiple ad groups.Perhaps you should segment out segmenting out Um campaigns based on service category.Perhaps you should be segmenting out ad groups or campaigns based on key service locations or countries.Um, so there's opportunities potentially to segment an account that's two, two consolidated launchinga Pmax campaign.Many accounts that we see have not yet launched their first Pmax campaign.That's a great quick win.Um, to explore testing Google's most really most important campaign format today, turn off networkplacements.Are the search campaigns, um, opting in to Google search networks where the quality of traffic isgoing to be not as good.You could turn off those network placements, adjust your bid adjustments.So are you adjusting bids based on devices or certain locations?Um, are you likewise to the next one?Adjusting Roas or CPA targets based on performance and goals are the target Roas.Do you have a target Roas that's too high and it's constricting the the the the the the engine.If your breakeven Roas is 200% and your target Roas is 800%, you're telling Google you want an eighttimes return, then maybe you should lower that return benchmark to see if you can get more scale ata three times return.Same thing for CPA.Do you have your remarketing audiences set up?That's a great thing.Spend a lot of time in the audience's, um, tool inside Google, looking at your custom segments,your remarketing audiences, and your your combination segments so you could have remarketing audiences.Anyone who's been to the site in the last 90 days, plus people who are in the in market for a certaincategory, you could have anybody who's been to your site in the last seven days, plus people who aresearching Google a custom intent audience, create those audiences and start applying those audiencesto campaigns, even if it's just an observation mode.Negative keywords do an audit of the negative keyword strategy.You might have negative keywords added as lists at the account level.You could have negative keywords at the campaign level, and you could have negative keywords at thead group level.Do a full analysis of negative keywords and spot opportunities for additional negative keywords.Look through your ad copy for typos.Look for your ad copy for better headlines and better descriptions.Look for egregious errors like no conversion tracking.Set up only 1 or 2 headlines in an ad.Only one out of four descriptions in an ad.Incorrect audiences, incorrect placements.Um, really bad use of budget or budget or bid caps or bidding settings and make a list of things thatyou feel are egregious.Budget adjustments.Look at the daily budgets that are being applied to different campaigns.Look at which campaigns are limited by budget.Which campaigns have more budget opportunity?Make sure that your landing page URLs are accurate, that the right that the ads and each ad group aregoing to the right page on.On the right website, we see we spot a ton of issues when auditing whether or not URLs are accurate.Landing pages are correct.Make sure that the landing pages are loading properly, that they have the right information, thatthey have a clear call to action.This is another opportunity where so much movement can happen.If you're sending people to a bad landing page, nothing you do in Google is going to matter.It's all going to come down to a broken experience.Once they land at the destination you're sending them, and all of that money you spent on acquisitionis going to have gone to waste more or less budget to brand it.So this is a common question.We've spoken about this in detail about pot odds, and we spoke about the the different considerationsaround bidding on branded terms.But decide do you want to spend more money on branded or less money on branded.And again, you could have a sophisticated, intelligent conversation around that.Um, and lastly, turn off underperforming campaigns, ad groups, asset groups, ads and keywords.You're going to spot.You use a filter.Remember we talked about filtering out go into your filter at the campaign level or at the ad grouplevel, at the ad group level, at the keyword level, at the ad level.And search for an asset, a campaign that has $300 300 or more clicks.Or maybe it has $1,000 in more spend and it has less than three conversions.Or you could filter out assets or campaigns that have a CPA above the average in the account.And you could say, hey, is this an underperforming campaign that we should just pause for now becauseit's too expensive and it's dragging down the performance as a whole?That's a great thing to do in an audit.So that is our Google Ads simplified cheat sheet.I think it's super useful.It's it's it's a really helpful just list to have in case you're feeling overwhelmed.And then you're going to be able to run these audits more effectively.And as you follow along this, this, this list, your brain is going to like discover new things youcould do and new areas of the account to check in on.And by the time you get done top to bottom, you're going to have like a really good, um, feel forthe account and a really good way to start thinking about strategy optimizations and quick wins movingforward.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about all the key takeaways and try to synopsize everythingwe've learned in this, um, Google Ads training course.I'll see you there shortly.
