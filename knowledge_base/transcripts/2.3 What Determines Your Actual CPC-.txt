# 2.3 What Determines Your Actual CPC-

So what factors contribute to CPC?Three key factors influence what your actual CPC is.Number one is your bid.The bid amount is the maximum you are willing to pay per click.Number two is your quality score.It is a numeric value on a scale of 1 to 10.And quality score includes your expected click through rate.How likely Google thinks you are to receive a click.Remember, Google is economically incentivized by one thing and one thing only, and that is receivingclicks.So Google wants to know your the Google will ascribe or assign a quality between 1 and 10 to your adbased on their expected click through rate of your actual ad matched up with any given search.The relevance of your ad.Google ultimately wants to provide relevant results.And number three, the landing page experience how relevant and navigable and clear and informative.Your landing pages in relationship to the query in relationship to what the user searched in Google.That's the second component of your actual CPC.And third is ad rank.AD rank is calculated from your bid and quality score.It's a multiplication.For example, if your bid is $4 and you have a quality score of eight, you're going to have an ad rankof 32.The highest ad rank gets the highest spot.And what you'll notice when you look at this math, you don't necessarily have to have the highest bidto have the highest spot.For example, if somebody bids in our case, we bid $4.But say somebody bid $10 more than double you and has a quality score of two, their ad rank is 20.They're going to be lower down on the page.And they can very likely pay $9 for their click where we're going to be at the top of the page, orwe're going to be above that competitor.And because our max bid was $4, we're never going to pay more than $4.We might pay less than $4, but we're going to get higher real estate for a lower price than competitors,because quality score has such a dramatic impact on where our ads appear.Now, back in the day, we would spend a lot of time talking about manual bidding.And manual bidding still has a place.We still see a lot of campaigns that are most profitable in a manual bidding environment, and manualbidding just means that you manually give Google a max CPC bid for every single keyword in your account.So if there are 10,000 keywords, you're going to have 10,000 bids.And a big part of our life was managing actual individual bids on a keyword by keyword basis, goingback five, six, seven years ago.But that's changed.Smart bidding is Google's new way of saying to you, the advertiser, look, you don't really care whatyou pay us per click.What you care is whether these campaigns hit your actual goals.What you care if you get a positive return on your investment, you care if you're generating new customersand sales at a profit.You care if what if the money you make is is more than the money you spend?That's ultimately what you care about.And you as a human are going to make a lot of errors when trying to give us your maximum CPC bid.One, your math's going to be off.Your analysis is going to be off.You're not going to really know exactly what's worth paying what what every single individual searchterm is worth based on expected conversion rates, average order values.It's just going to be too much for you to manage.That's one.But two.And more importantly is that averages are always wrong.Google Is assigning or you are assigning a bid for a keyword.Let's let's go back to our example of Wi-Fi enabled coffee mugs.So I sell Wi-Fi enabled coffee mugs.And you're going to Google.And the customer is going to Google and search and Google for Wi-Fi enabled coffee mugs.And I tell Google, I'm willing to pay $4 a click because, um, my my my profit, my my break evenprofit is 16 bucks, let's say.And my conversion rate tends to be 25%.So I know if I spend $4, I'm going to spend at most $16 to generate the sale.And I'm happy to be break even at 16 bucks, break even to acquire the new customer, because I knowin a week they're going to buy a replacement bass and a couple of extra chargers and maybe get the mugas a gift for their for their girlfriend.Fine.The problem with that is it assumes that all searches for Wi-Fi enabled mug are equal.But the truth is, they're not.Even within the very same keyword and search term.There's an enormous amount of variance.You have people who are about to buy.You have people who will never buy.You have people who are looking for images.You have people who are doing research.You have people who are looking at competitive analysis.You have people who are just window shopping.You have people who are looking up more information about the industry as a whole.It's like a gigantic amount of variance.And we as advertisers in the Google Ads ecosystem, we don't have access to all the credit card data,the GPS data, the behavioral data, what Google knows about each individual user logged into Gmailand their entire behavioral, psychological, demographic, psychographic paradigm.We don't have access to it, but Google does.So Google is saying, look, with smart bidding, forget CPC bids, forget max bids.You don't have to give us a bid because you don't actually care what you pay per click, which is true.And Google is saying we're going to do a better job in identifying the search terms that have a higherpredicted conversion rate.And of course, when Google says search terms, what they really mean are individuals.Google is saying if you give control to us to set your max bids, we're going to have more leverageand flexibility.Bidding more than $4, which is the right bid for the person about to convert, right?So if somebody has a 70% likelihood of likelihood to convert, then I should be willing to bid $12 forthat click.But if somebody has a 1% likelihood to convert, I shouldn't want to bid for dollars either.That's too high.The problem with the average max CPC bid using average data sets like my average conversion rate andmy average order value, is that the actual bid I get, Google is going to be almost always wrong.It's either going to be too little or it's going to be too much.And the whole idea of smart bidding is to get that bid that Google enters into the auction on our behalf,more accurate reflection of our benchmarks.Some of the factors that smart bidding takes into account.Number one user signals and context.Location.Device time of day.Day of the week.AD schedule.Language.Operating system.All of these different individual factors help Google understand who this person is and what they'relooking to buy, and how likely they are to purchase it.Number two behavioral signals previous interactions, previous search terms, remarketing lists thatthat user is on in-market audiences.Are they in the market for romance novels or are they in the market for a Porsche, or are they in themarket for a bottle of sparkling water?Or maybe all three?Custom intent audiences Google has access to the world's richest trove of search data.Google knows what you've searched.Google knows what you search on your phone.Google knows what you've searched on your desktop.Google has access to voice information.Google has a very good read on the things that you want to buy, and Google could actually tap intothat.Now when setting your bid with smart bids, historical performance data of conversion rate and CTR.Google might know that some of your products and services sell really well in the evening or the morning,or over the weekends or during certain seasons.And instead of you having to either use an average or be spending full time in an account and makingadjustments every hour or when the weather changes, Google is able to do that for you with smart bidding.The competitive landscape Google has a sense of what your competitors are doing and how they're modifyingtheir bids and their performance bid strategy goals.Google's going to ask you when you set up an account.Google's going to say, do you want to generate a certain CPA?Do you want is your business goal to get leads at below a certain cost?So, for example, for Adventure Media's campaigns, when we generate business through our own GoogleAds campaigns, we're a lead gen business.We're a service based business.So I'm not waiting months or weeks through a whole sales cycle to give Google back revenue data on closeddeals from HubSpot.It's a complex that's a complex ecosystem to build.It's certainly buildable.However, I know that leads are there's always going to be variance in the leads that we generate.Right.And this is these are the types of strategic ways of thinking that you as a practitioner have to beable to, to go through.So I know that we're going to have variance in lead quality no matter what.But I also know based on our average profit and our and our expected lifetime value of a client, Icould back into what I want to pay for a lead.For us, it happens to be 400 bucks or 500 bucks for for a lead from Google Ads.So we tell Google, bid whatever you want on any of the keywords we suggest, but we want to make surethat we're getting those leads, those actual form fills for 400 or $500 or less.That's called target CPA bidding.You could also bid on target return on ad spend.This is very popular for ecommerce businesses.Say for example, you sell these Wi-Fi enabled coffee mugs and you that you sell them for 100 buckseach.And because of your cost of goods sold and and your overhead, you need to generate $200 in revenuefor every $100 you spend on advertising, so you need A2X return.Maybe you need to generate $300 in revenue for every $100 in advertising spend.So then you could tell Google you're going to be seeing information on our revenue that we're generatingfrom these campaigns.So we need a target return on ad spend of 300%.That means for every dollar you take out of my pocket Google, I need $3 in sales.Now, Google may or may not be able to actually achieve that goal.That's a whole separate can of worms, and it's a topic of conversation that we're going to get intoin another module.How to set achievable, realistic Roas targets.But it is a way of structuring your smart bidding.You could also have Google maximize conversions, say, hey, I'm not super worried about CPA or superworried about return on ad spend.Right now I just want to get the highest volume of customers.This is great for brands that want to capture market share for a competitor This is great for brandsthat need to show investors a growth trajectory where margin and profit are not the most immediate concerns.And lastly, maximize conversion value when brands need to show revenue growth.Maximize conversion value means get me the best quality conversions the people who are going to spendthe most.So maximize conversion value is rare to see with a lead gen business.However, it's reasonably common to see with e-commerce businesses that have a wide range of productsand price points.Add relevance and daily budget are also factors Google is going to take into account when figuring outwho to show your ad to throughout the day, and how much to bid on showing that ad.So your daily budget, is it constrained?Is it wide open?Is is.Does Google have to take into account your daily budget plus a target Roas, or is it a daily budgetthat's constrained plus a maximized conversion value?All of those factors are going to go into play with smart bidding and the number of advertisers.The number of advertisers bidding on the same keywords absolutely does affect your cost.So the more saturated the competition and the more expensive and the more valuable these customers are,the more expensive your products and the more valuable those customers are.Those are the factors that are going to drive up CPC as advertisers.Your competitors tell Google we're willing to pay more.They bid up the auction prices to secure those top positions.Diving into quality score briefly.Quality score, in short, is a measure of the quality and relevance of your ads, keywords and landingpages.It's exactly how it sounds.Google wants to make sure that they're showing high quality, relevant results.Google does not want to look like an advertising page.The Google search results page is a beautiful, elegant, native, hidden, secretive advertising behemothVery few people actually understand or realize that the results at the top are ads.One Google has only a very small little icon, a little badge, and you could miss it if you're notaware.Two the results.The actual ads are very relevant to what I'm searching for, and Google has gone to great lengths tomake sure that that happens and it stays that way.And that's why Google introduced Quality Score in 2005.Quality score influences influences both your actual CPC and your ad rank, like we discussed previously.And the three components like we mentioned, are the expected click through rate of your ad paired upwith the search term of that specific auction, the relevance of your ad, and the landing page experience,how good your landing page is, how navigable it is, and the most important component of these three.Maybe you can guess it.You can take a moment to think about it.You can pause it.Which of these three is the most important component of quality score?It's expected click through rate.Of course, the answer is obvious.Maybe not because Google makes money when their ads get clicked.So if Google if Google's model looking at your historic data, indicates that you're going to have anabove average likelihood of receiving a click, that means Google is going to incentivize you with lowerprices in the auction and better placement because Google, Google's ability to earn revenue on anysearch, is binary.It either happens or it doesn't.So if somebody clicks on an organic result, Google does not earn any revenue.If Google somebody clicks a paid result at the top of the page, Google earns money.So Google wants to create the best possible ad experience for their customers.They want those ads getting clicked.If Google thinks your ad is going to receive a click compared to a competitive ad less likely to receivea click, you're going to be rewarded with a higher position, better real estate, and a lower price.The highest ad rank wins the auction.Like we discussed, your max CPC bid multiplied by our quality score plus the extensions, your addextensions that you'll use.That's what gives you your ad rank.There are minimum ad rank thresholds to enter into the auction, so you might be wondering what if Ihave a $1 bid and a two quality score with an ad rank of two?You might not make it into the auction.Google is not public, and they're not transparent with what those ad rank thresholds are.But you might see a warning beside the keyword in your account that says your ad rank is too low, andin that case, you're going to have to either increase your bid or increase your quality score.AD extensions like we'll talk about them in more detail like site link extensions, call outs, structuredsnippets.They can improve your ads performance and quality score, while at the same time most likely loweringyour actual CPC.So not only does quality score improve the likelihood of you getting clicked, but working on your qualityscore and getting a higher spot in the auction is actually going to lower your CPC, because you willnot need to bid as much to maintain an ad rank that's higher than the competition, than the competition.
