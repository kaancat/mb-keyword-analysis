# 10.2 The Anatomy of a Search Campaign

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to talk about the anatomy of a search campaign.This graphic might be a um you might remember it from a previous lecture.We've seen a similar type of hierarchy, but just it's good to review.So at the top you have your campaigns inside your account.Inside each campaign you have ad groups in your ad groups.So ad group one A and ad group one B would be contained within one search campaign, ad group two Aand ad group two B might be ad groups in another search campaign.In each ad group, you want to thematically group your keywords so you have a bunch of keywords.And then for a group of keywords in an ad group, you also have responsive search ads.For your responsive search ads, you're going to have landing pages.The landing pages are where anybody who clicks on an ad is going to land.You can add a landing page at the keyword level.So a keyword will have a specific landing page.And that will override the landing page you you specify in the ad.Or you could most more typically use your rsas your responsive search ads to direct traffic to the landingpage.You apply to the responsive search ad, and the same thing would be for the other search campaign.At the ad group level is where you can add all of your audience targeting layers.So your observation, your targeting, your remarketing audiences, your in-market segments, your affinitylists, your custom affinity audiences.But keep in mind audience targeting that you add at a more granular level, like an ad group is goingto take precedence over the broader settings defined at a higher level, like the campaign.So if you have an audience definition at the campaign, the audience definition you set at the ad grouplevel will take precedence.Some of the settings that you set up at the campaign level is the network.Am I running just on Google search?Am I running on YouTube?Am I running a video campaign or an app campaign?Am I running on search partners locations?You want your ads to appear in the language you want your the language you want your audience to speakand to be fluent in in order for them to be eligible to see your ad, your daily budgets, your bidstrategies, your ad extensions, audience targeting as well can be set at the campaign level.Um, but remember, you could also set those audience targeting parameters and cohorts at the ad grouplevel.You can have different goals and bid strategies across different ad groups, but that's not somethingwhich is typically common.And you could also set ad extensions at the ad group level.So for example, you might want to have standard ad extensions like your contact page or a case studypage or a collection page at the at the at the campaign level.But then you might want to have then you might have an ad group that's targeting a specific categoryof product and within that category of products.So let's say you're you're selling evening gowns.So you might have floral mother of the bride um, bridesmaid summer collections.Right.So you might have a bunch of different styling extensions really only relevant to your evening dressescampaign or ad group rather.And then you would have your specified specific sitelink extensions for an ad group that will overridethe extension set at the search At the search campaign level.Keep in mind that negative keywords we spoke about, negative keywords, negative keywords can be addedto the account campaign and at the ad group level.I'm going to share my screen, and we're going to quickly walk through the hierarchy of a search campaignin the actual dashboard.So here we have a client account.This is what the Google Ads dashboard looks like on the left hand.We on the left hand, we have a vertical menu that allows us to navigate across this account.So under campaigns and I'm at the campaigns tab.These are all the search campaigns or these are all the campaigns in the account.So under all campaigns or all the campaigns.And I can see here that this is an account that spent around $40,000 in the last 30 days.And of course we can adjust our columns, we'll talk about a full we're going to go through a full dashboard,walk through and get a sense of all these columns and buttons and panels and tools and another video.But I just want to show you the hierarchy of how this drops down for a search campaign.So at the top I have a filter I can filter by all campaigns.But let's say I want to I just want to see my search campaigns.So I'll click search campaigns.I'm still on the campaigns type, but my view, my report is filtered by just search campaigns.Now, if I navigated to ad groups over here, I would see all of the ad groups inside all of the searchcampaigns because I did not select an individual campaign.There's two ways I could select a campaign.I could either go back to the campaign tab and click into a campaign.So if I clicked into this campaign right here, I'm now going to only see the ad groups inside thatcampaign.And I'm only going to see the results and the columns I have selected for that ad group.Or I can go back to campaigns.I could go to search campaigns.I'm seeing all my search campaigns again, and if I went down to ad groups, I could use this filterup above to just filter out any of the campaigns I wanted to see.So if I wanted to see ad groups for that campaign, I could filter it above in the horizontal menu aswell.Um, I'm sort of old school, and I'm used to the old Google Ads UI that didn't have this filter uphere.So I typically I typically don't use it.If I wanted to clear filters I can go over here.Clear.Clear that filter for that campaign.If I wanted to go back here, go to all campaigns.I typically start with going to the campaigns tab, selecting the ad group that I like and clickinginto it.So if I wanted to see in here, okay, I have an ad group.If there was five ad groups, it would all show here.And if I click into the ad group, I'm now going to be able to see a few more layers of detail for thatad group.So here we have our keywords.These are the keywords inside this snap ad group.And this is an ad group inside this campaign.The green dot means that it's enabled.The plus sign means that this keyword is paused and is not currently delivering.I could also see my audiences for this ad group.I could see audience results.I could see my ads for this ad group in the ad tab.So these are the ads that are inside this specific ad group.So for example, if I wanted to see more ads that are across all the ad groups in the campaigns, Iwould go back up to the campaigns, okay, I would remove my filters.I would go over here and go back to all campaigns, click all campaigns up here.And now I'm back to my all campaigns view, and I'm just going to click instead of going into an adgroup, I'm going to click ads.And now I'm going to see a report that has all of the ads across all of the ad groups in the account.And again, I can go to campaigns, I can go into a specific I could select just see just to see searchcampaigns.I could filter by cost.I can go into here and I could see these are one, two, three, four, five different ad groups insideone campaign.I could click into a any given ad group and I could see the keywords.And if I want to switch from keywords to ads, I go from search keywords and I go to see our ads.So that's that's just roughly understanding the hierarchy of campaigns, ad groups and keywords insidean actual Google Ads dashboard.And in the next lecture, we're going to talk in a little bit more detail about what is a very excitingGoogle product called Responsive Search Ads.We'll see you shortly.
