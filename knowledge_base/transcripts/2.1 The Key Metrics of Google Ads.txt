# 2.1 The Key Metrics of Google Ads

So let's just talk a little bit about Google Ads fundamentals.To some of you this might be common knowledge.You might be well aware, but um, for others it won't be.And if you've heard of these things before, it could be a little bit of a refresher.So Google ads, I like to say, is a platform for the people.It's the most luxurious, powerful and profitable advertising company platform on the face of planetEarth.Why?Think about what differentiates Google from a billboard.Google search from meta, from advertising on Facebook or Instagram.And the key differentiator is that Google search advertising.It helps an advertiser, somebody selling a goods or a service capitalize on search intent.Showing ads to users actively searching for related products or Services, ensuring relevance and engagement.Think about it for a moment.What other advertising platform can you get inside a customer's or prospects head and only show thema message or an ad at the very moment that they're searching for your products?That is the essence.That's the crux of search advertising.Say you sell white shoes or sell.You say you sell Wi-Fi enabled coffee mugs, or you sell baseball caps.Well, traditionally you would advertise on billboards or display advertising or to audiences who youthink based on their previous browsing activity or their demographic information might be interestedin sneakers or coffee mugs or baseball hats.But what if you didn't have to rely on that broader information?What if you could show an ad for a baseball hat?The moment somebody went to Google and searched for buy By baseball hats online.That's why Google took off.That's why 97, 98% of Google's revenue, at least a few years ago was, um, it's a little bit lessnow.They have phones, they have cloud services, etc. but still, the vast majority of Google's revenuecomes from ad clicks.And the reason they do such a good job is because they want to deliver the most relevant results.Read advertising to its users.The more relevant their results, the more clicks Google will receive, and the more clicks Google willreceive, the higher their revenue is going to be.Let's review the key metrics that are most important for you to understand when you're talking aboutGoogle Ads.It's three key metrics.Cost per click, conversion rate, and average order value.These three metrics are going to allow you to get a variety of benchmarks for profitability and mostof the reports and most of the conversations you're going to have when it comes to optimizing campaignsand making actual decisions are going to revolve around these three metrics.So cost per click is is is the amount you actually pay per click.People often confuse cost per click with their max bid.Your max bid in a manual bidding environment is what you're telling Google.You're willing to pay for a click for any given search term or keyword.Your cost per click is how much you've actually paid Google.For example, I might tell Google I'm willing to pay $4 for anybody searching for Wi-Fi enabled coffeemug, but my actual click might end up being $3.74.Your average CPC.If you're looking at a date range and you're looking at an aggregate of multiple clicks, you'll seea column that says average CPC.That's the average cost you've paid per click.Some clicks might have been $2, some clicks might have been $8, some clicks might have been $4.And based on the volume and the specific amount Google charged you.For every individual click, Google will show you that average conversion rate, often confused withconversions.Conversion.Let's define the word conversion.Conversion does not just mean a sale, and it does not just mean a form submission, or a phone callor an mql for a service based business.A conversion could be any action a user takes on your site that is of any sort of value to you.E-commerce is a great example.Typically when we talk about conversions, we do mean sales.How many conversions did your your your company that sells iPhone cases have yesterday?36.Okay.So we're talking about sales there in most cases however, and this is very applicable to service basedbusinesses.But even e-commerce businesses that have a little bit of a longer lead time, if I get an add to cart,it would be smart to track that as a conversion If I have somebody visiting seven pages of the sitewhen the average visit visit average visitor visits two pages, a seven page session might be trackedas a conversion.We will use Google Analytics for Ga4 to configure those conversions and send them back into Google Ads.So that's what a conversion is.A conversion is any action that's meaningful to you that you want to track and report on.And it's true, visitors of any page might be meaningful.Um, clicking around in certain areas of the site are meaningful, but you wouldn't typically trackeverything as a conversion.You really want to look at conversions as significant actions that the minority of your website visitorsare taking, but they identify that minority to be in a group of highly valuable individuals.Conversion rate is just the percentage of such activities happening.So if I had 100 visitors on the site and ten of them converted, my conversion rate would be 10%.If I had 100 visitors on the site and two of them converted, my conversion rate would be 2%.If I had 100 visitors that converted by, um, requesting a brochure.And I'm tracking that as a conversion.100 visitors came to the brochure page and two people downloaded it.And then I had 100 visitors, the same 100 visitors.And out of those same 100 visitors, one person submitted a form.And I'm also tracking a form submission as a conversion.Well, then I would have two separate conversion rates.Every conversion action is going to have their own conversion rate.I'd have a 2% conversion rate on my brochure download, and I would have a 1% conversion rate on myform submission.Average order value AOV.This is an easy one.We're not talking about complicated ROI metrics.We're not talking about cost of goods sold.This is your average order value for ecommerce businesses in particular, how much money do you generateon average for a successful checkout?Most e-commerce businesses have a range of items, and those range of items have a range of associatedcosts.A service business could have a range of services.This would be average lifetime value for a service based business if you're looking to extend that valueover time.So, for example, let's say you're an agency and you sell advertising services, or you sell mediabuying services or SEO services, and you charge your clients a monthly retainer, you could look atyour average order value, which is the average amount of your first month's fee for a service.But if you're in HVAC, you might look at it for your average first service call.If you're a therapist, it would be your average revenue from your first session.You could also look at it as your lifetime average value.So on average, how long does a client stay?How much more does a client purchase?What is what?What average revenue can I expect to earn over the lifetime of this customer or this client?Um, Whether it's a service business or it's a lead gen business, it's a service business.A lead gen business or an e-commerce business.And look, ultimately, ultimately, this is a really important metric to understand because for youto gauge whether your cost per click is too high or too low, if your conversion rate has to be improved,it's all going to be moderated by your average order value.What you spend on advertising.And look, we're in the performance media world and performance matters.Profitability matters.No campaign is worth our admiration if it loses money, if it is not profitable, and how much you canspend before losing money.Um, and how much of that traffic that you're purchasing must convert before you're losing money isall going to ultimately come down to how much money you're generating and how much money you can anticipategenerating.So you look back at your average order value to look forward.When you plan your media budgets and you plan your different campaign strategies.
