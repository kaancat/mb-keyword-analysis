# 20.28 Keyword Organization- Getting Keywords Into Excel & Understanding Keyword Themes

How do Google ads fans and welcome back.And this exciting part of our journey to understanding keywords.We're going to talk about keyword organization, the final stages of our keyword training, let's say.There are a whole lot of ways to get Cuban information into Excel, and not every time it's going tobe necessary to get your keywords into Excel.If you're building out a smaller account and you have five or ten keywords and a few different ad groups,you may not necessarily need to do this, but I still think it's good to learn how to do this, howI do this.So you could at least see an approach that will help you build bigger accounts.Now, the first step is getting our keywords that we've researched into a spreadsheet.So this could be Google Sheets, it could be Excel.They both work the same way.I'm going to do it in Excel since most of you probably have Excel, but it works just as well, justas easily in Google sheets.Now, where are these keywords coming from?So well, we could have we've been doing exports from SEM Rush.We could download into a CSV from Google Keyword Planner.We were able to export from from Uber suggest Neil Patel's tool.We are able to keep track of keywords on a notepad as we go through some of these other suggestionslike Google Auto suggest and suggest and Google related searches and just ideas we have in our notepad,even ideas we have in our in our current account.So if you're managing a campaign or if you've inherited a campaign that have that has a lot of keywordsin it, what we're doing here is good for structuring keywords.But also restructuring.So don't make the mistake that and think this is only a good idea and a good approach and a good organizationexercise for brand new accounts.We do this routinely for accounts that have thousands and tens of tens of thousands of keywords willexport all the keywords into Excel.And we'll sort of look at how we would ideally want to structure an account if we were building thisfrom scratch and then say, okay, what's actually feasible for us to do?What are the things that we should work on first here?So first, let me show you one more time how to export and download a list of keywords in your accounts.I'm going to jump back into into Google ads and here's our office chairs.I could go into the campaign, but even from all campaigns, if I want to download all my keywords,I can just go over to the keywords and simply click the download button right over here and Excel.CSV would be the file that I want to download it in and it's going to download really quickly and Ican open it up.But I sort of jumped the gun a little bit for the sake of time and I've created a separate spreadsheetin Excel.Let's pull that up over here.So I have a few different workbooks or a few different sheets down here, and we're going to go througheach of them and they all sort of serve a different purpose.The first step is getting a list of all the different keyword ideas you have.So here you have a list of around 70 keywords.This is related to our chair campaign that we're building out and popping, and this is by no meansa totally comprehensive list of all the different ideas that we've had.But it's it's getting there in terms of bringing together a number of these different ideas we've hadand now talking about these thematically related groups of keywords.So before we go further, let's take another moment to review this idea of thematically related groupsof keywords.And on the topic of themes, we sort of have three things that we want to talk about here.So one is themes.And themes are going to really make your ad group structure themes really has to do with relevancy.In its most direct at its most direct level.The reason why we were looking to group our keywords by themes, the whole purpose of that is for relevancy.And we spoke about this before, but the relevancy of your ads to what the person searching for theinformation in the ads, the promotions, the sales, whatever content that calls to action, and thenwhere you're sending that person.So thematically related groups of keywords all focuses on relevancy and you have to understand yourwebsite structure.Take that into account.But you're also optimizing for two factors.You're optimizing for humans human relevancy, but you're also trying to make Google happy.There's two different factors when it comes to thinking about relevancy, and usually there's an overlapin most, and there's supposed to be an overlap.So when you're optimizing well for humans, when you're writing proper ad copy and you're getting ahigh click through rate and you're sending them to the right content that has the right information,you're accomplishing both things at once.The second important component of what we're doing here with organization is the buyer funnel.And the buyer funnel really has to do with your bid, which is at the keyword level, aggregate level,default bids, campaign level default bids and your overall budget for the campaigns.And you're going to start thinking about does a keyword or a specific theme relate to a certain level,certain place in the buyer funnel?And we've spoken about the buyer funnel and you understand how to identify keywords and themes thatthat relate to the buyer funnel.And then lastly is matched types and match types.Within a group within a theme are going to help us control.What we spend how much we spend matched types gives us that control, allowing saying, okay, withthis keyword, you have this much freedom, Google with this keyword, you have this much freedom,which is why I'm going to be bidding X for this and why for that.And we're going to start putting some of these ideas together in this section as we go through our keywordlist.So let's jump back into Excel.So here I am back in Excel.And this, in your case, should be an overall messy.This is a little bit neater than yours.Yours will probably be, but it should be a messy list of all your keyword research ideas, right?You haven't necessarily solidified your themes by now.You probably have a good understanding how you want to break down your themes.And remember, we spoke about all these different ways you could break out themes.So themes could be they could be product based.Service based.Funnel based.They could be even within product category.It could be product category.Type B could be model numbers.You can have themes, could be locations.And again, themes are going to be based on do you want to send this traffic to a specific place onyour website or a specific landing page?Will the value of these keywords be different than the value of other keywords, and will your ad copyneed to be specific to?So you're very, very relevant.So if a person searches for a specific thing, a specific search term, that includes one of these themesthat are unique identifier that are some sort of distinctive property, then you'd want to be able towrite tailored X, you'd want to be able to write tailored ad copy.And I think that that's a good way to think about it.Themes should be.Distinctive properties.So let's go back into Excel and take a look.And yes, let's take a look if we could see and start thinking about some of our distinctive propertieshere.So I take a look at a keyword here.Ergonomic office chair.All right.So what would be a theme here?We know that my overall campaign is targeting office chairs, but what would we say is a theme?So I think a theme would be ergonomic.That's a theme.I can continue to scroll down and take a look at what else is going on here.Trying to pick up on some other potential themes.So here's a couple of keywords and we see rolling office chair, rolling desk chair.These are some ideas that I've gotten from my tools rolling desk seating, luxury office chair, leatheroffice seating.So what are some themes?So here we have a bunch of different potential.Differentiating factors within these search terms like we see desk.Right and there's office.They are ceding vice chair but these would not what these wouldn't be themes.These are not distinctive characteristics.Desk chair.Office chair that doesn't represent a different buyer.Office Chair Office seating doesn't represent a different buyer.What you want to look for is, is somebody looking for something unique that's different than the otherterm.So when before we had ergonomic, that tells me something about what the person's looking for and whereI could send them and how my ad copy could be.Again, if somebody's looking for office seating or office chairs, you might argue, Well, isn't itbetter to have an algorithm that talks about with those words?In an ideal world, yes, but in in practicality, it doesn't make that much of a difference, if anyat all, especially not because you're not going to be sending people to different pages.If somebody if somebody searches for purple office, desk chair or purpose or purple office chair,you're going to send them on to a site that has you're going to send them to a page of your site thatcaters to that defining, distinctive characteristic, which in that case was the word purple.So those are the things you want to be thinking about.So if we take a look at a bunch of these search terms over here, what are the themes?What are distinctive characteristics?All right.So I think we had ergonomic luxury.Maybe we were going to send them to a filter view of higher priced items.Leather is another theme.That's a distinctive characteristic.If somebody searches for leather in their search term, I want to be able to write at my ad that wehave leather seats and I want to and I want to send them to a section of the site that sells and listsall our leather office chairs.Conference room is another theme that's a distinctive characteristic of the type of chair executive.There's another distinctive theme rolling and maybe we'll do Rolling and Wheels.Maybe we'll do rolling wheels and swivel.All part of the same ad group.That's all sort of the same theme.These are all thematically related.1 to 3.If we continue to scroll down.We see colorful discount home, kneeling computer, white, modern standing.Right?So I'm getting a bunch of these ideas.And again, this would be not necessarily an organized list, but just an overall list of all the research,all in sort of along all my ideas.Right.I haven't decided if I'm going to bid on all these yet.I haven't decided if these are all going to be my ADD groups.I'm going to use the volume estimates that I, I worked on in the previous in the in the previous toolslike Rush and Google Keyword Planner to sort of whittle out or remove some of these keyword ideas ifit's if it's going to be too low volume, things like that.So I want to start putting together themes in these keywords.So I'm going to say, okay, we have we have ergonomic.We have rolling.We have luxury.Leather.Executive.Colorful, white.Computer.Modern and let's do standing, right?So let's say modern and standing.So let's say these are all the themes that I decide are the ones that I want to start off with.Now, these are going to be my ADD groups, your thematically related organization.This is what's going to turn into what your ad groups are eventually going to be.Now, there is one other important component to think of as you're going through your thematically relatedgroups of keywords are funnel modifiers.Are there certain search terms?Are there certain themes that that don't necessarily represent a type of product, but they representa level in the funnel or a likelihood to buy.So in our example, I came up with two examples.Cheap and discounted may not be distinctive characteristics of the types of products I sell, but theycould be types of they could be included with the search terms in any of these themes.So for example, if somebody's searching for ergonomic office chair, somebody might search for cheapergonomic office chair or discounted rolling desk chair.And how am I going to deal with those?Do I want to cut those out completely?Or perhaps I just want to bid a little bit less?I'd rather pay a little bit less than for the click because I don't really know how much money a personis willing to spend if they use the word cheap or they use the word discounted or they use the wordsale.Right?So why take a guess?Maybe I could include these keywords as modifiers put them into my campaigns, put them into my ad groupsin two potentially different ways.One is I could have my own ad groups.For any of these funnel modifiers.So I could have an ad group that includes cheap.So for any of these aid groups ergonomic, rolling, luxury leather executive, colorful white computerand modern, let's say I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.Then I would have 18 add groups a duplicate of each of these add groups that includes the word cheap.And if I could do it again with sale and discounted, I can add all those three into one add group andstill stay with 18 add groups.So I'm going to start with these nine main themes.But another way to do it is to add these funnel modifiers as as keywords into the original campaigns.So ergonomic office chair would be a keyword in my ergonomic themed add group, but I would also havecheap ergonomic office chair with a lower manual.Max CPC bid.That's important because if I'm bidding manually, I'll have the ability to individually lower the costper click of that keyword.And same thing with discounted.Same thing with potentially for sale, etc..I don't have to create separate groups, although if it's going to be a very, very high volume campaign,it would it might be worthwhile to create separate groups for that.So this is the first step in working in massaging your your all the keywords that you've done in yourresearch stage.So now I have I have 70 keywords, I have thousands of keywords.I want to show you quickly what this would look like for a service business.So on this keyword tab, I have a fictitious company that does carpet cleaning and all sorts of thingslike drapery cleaning, upholstery cleaning, window cleaning, power washing, pressure washing, andthey service a bunch of different areas.So I created a list of keywords that has I think there's around 3000 keywords here for cleaning, carpetcleaning, steam cleaning a story.A company is quotes, right?There's literally 3000 keywords here or so, 2500 keywords and all different locations.And this is a typical build out of what a keyword structure could look like after doing a lot of research.So again, if you're a service business, you would want to start identifying those themes.And what exactly are those themes?I think there are two primary sections to those themes.I think you have location.So you have New York, Hempstead, Brookhaven, Islip, right.These would all be themes.But I also think you have this service.So carpet cleaning could be a theme.And if we scroll down you'll see that power washing could be a theme, house cleaning could be a theme.These are people that are looking for specific things and these are people that would be sent to a specificpage in your site that talks about that specific service.So the top level theme and the most important thematically related distinction would be the actual servicea person is looking for.But then you have location.If people are searching for specific locations, maybe you have separate pages on your site that caterto each town or each state or whatever that may be.If you don't, if all the content is the same, then you might not have to segment out your ad groupsby location.You might want to segment out your average by location.It all depends on the volume.It all depends on the content on your website.But the main thing to think about is if you were somebody searching for this product, would you wantto see an ad that talks about that specific dimension?So again, seating versus the word chairs is not a dimension you care to distinguish.But if if a location is something that you care to see, that they they service this specific locationor this specific zip code, then you might want to break those out into different ad groups.And if you have separate content on your site, it's another reason to break those out into differentad groups.So the same way we're doing this for E commerce based on product or product identifier, you can dothis for service businesses, for leads and businesses for any conversion action you could.You must be able to identify thematically related groups of keywords.Now, once I have my thematically related groups of keywords going back to pop in, I now have my one,two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine ad groups that I want to start with.And the next lecture, we're going to copy these and go into our all keywords tab and begin formattingour keywords properly into the actual themes that we're creating.And then we're going to start building out what our ad structure will look like and then show you howto visualize that as well.So we're going to continue right from where we left off in the very next lecture.And I look forward to seeing you guys there in a couple of seconds on the other side.
