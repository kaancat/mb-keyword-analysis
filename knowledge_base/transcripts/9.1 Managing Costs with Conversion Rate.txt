# 9.1 Managing Costs with Conversion Rate

We've talked about bidding strategies, we've talked about competition.Now we're going to talk about conversion rate and how conversion rate impacts costs.There's a whole stream of work that we call conversion rate optimization.And that's just a fancy way of saying we want to improve our conversion rate.We want to get a higher conversion rate than we were getting.So think about it.What if you can bring your conversion rate up to 10% or 12%?What if it drops to 5%?Say for example, you're sitting at an 8% conversion rate, so you have a 10,000 impressions, for example,500 clicks and 45 conversions.So out of those, um, 500 clicks, you have 45 conversions.And that gives you a 9% conversion rate.How do we get there.Your click through rate is 5%.That gives you 500 clicks.Your 500 clicks cost an average of $2.25.That gives you a $1,125 cost.The 500 clicks have a 9% conversion rate, generating 45 conversions.Now, it's important to think about how this dynamic changes with an increased conversion rate.So, for example, if our conversion rate was 12%, then we'd have 60 conversions.That's an additional 15 sales from the same 10,000 impressions for the same $1,125, $1,125 cost toGoogle cost per conversion directly correlates with conversion rate.So to get your cost per conversion, you're taking your total cost.You're dividing it by the number of conversions.In this case, we have a $1,125 cost with 45 conversions.That gives us a $25 CPA, a $25 cost per conversion.If you could increase your conversion rate.Right.And instead of that 9% conversion rate, we had a a 12% conversion rate and we were generating 60 conversions.Our CPA would be 1875, and that could very likely spell the difference between a successful campaignthat could be expanded and could generate a ton of revenue for a business and do it profitably, thana campaign that would have to be shut off.So thinking about conversion rate optimization is super important.Um, I teach a pretty lengthy and detailed course specifically on conversion rate optimization.Um, we have a free CRO mini course where I walk through over the course of a couple hours.The top five things that you can implement in under 30 minutes.Talk about user testing, talking about storytelling, talking about clarity, talking about legitimacyand trust.I highly recommend you check out the free CRO mini course.And there's also a full landing page optimization masterclass, where we really design and create optimizedlanding pages from scratch using advanced conversion rate optimization strategies.And I encourage you to check that out as well.So we covered key pillar number one, which was understanding the user.We covered key pillar number two managing cost.And now we're going to move on to discussing key pillar number three how to leverage machine learning.Look forward to seeing you there.
