# 13.5 Offline Conversion Tracking

Three.Welcome back.Now we're going to talk about conversion tracking technique.Number four offline conversion actions.Everything we've discussed until now really is more online conversion actions.But what if you know some of those mqls sqls or using some of that data in your system?Um, doesn't happen online.It happens offline.How do we send that information to Google so that it is able to properly track all of that?So you use the Google Ads conversion import button, which you're able to track conversions from clicksusing a Google Click identifier, also known as a G cloud, a g cloud, um, is when anyone clicks ona Google ad, they automatically get associated with a Google click identifier or a unique string ofletters and numbers that is attributed and is identified only with that click.You'll see it in the URL, so anytime you click an ad, you'll be able.If you scan the URL, you'll see.Click equals and it'll be a long string of numbers.That's your unique identifier.That's Google being able to say, ah, this ad that happened, someone clicked on this ad.Here's the unique identifier.Now I'm able to say this conversion action that happened was the same, you know, identifier had thisunique ID.Oh it happened from that ad.So that's how Google is able to track it.So if you know the Google click ID, um, and you're putting that with your offline conversion tracking,it's able to say, oh, it happened with that ad.Now how do we set that up?We'll talk about momentarily enhanced conversions for leads.That's another way that there's a conversion import.Um, that's also through offline conversion tracking.It's a newer methodology.Um, the click ID.method.Um, you know, importing offline conversions through gcloud is much more complicated and requires moreback end setup than enhanced conversions.Not as much which we will talk through.Um, there's also Salesforce.Some people are using Salesforce.So you could sync up and integrate, you know, the the Salesforce actions that happen and that you'retracking on your end.Add that directly to Google Ads.So that'll be a conversion import.There's HubSpot also offers a direct integration.And then we can also use Zapier, um, which helps move data from one area and feed it into Google Ads.Um, through offline conversion tracking, you can set up automations to happen.So let's say when someone you know marks this off as a lead, then send this information into Google.So that's all possible.Let's talk through the gcloud section.Conversions from clicks using the Google click identifier that G clinched its first created you firstcreate an imported conversion action.Then you upload the offline data using the upload feature and putting it on a recurring schedule.So you want to be able to have a specific sheet for Google.Um, I'll show you.Okay.I want to show you an example of what we mean by offline conversion tracking.So here's a template that Google gives.And some of this is already filled out.So this is the column for Google click ID.Here's an example of actual clicks.That and the unique identifier that was associated that came through.Um they're going to put in the conversion name whether it's form lead value or chat lead value.And then this is the conversion time.It has to be in a specific setup.This is a conversion value attributed.We came up with our own system here.Um, of the conversion value that we wanted to attribute.Maybe three was the best.One was okay.Zero was not a good lead.Um, the conversion currency and then the we had the names of the people they added, but that, um,Google doesn't take into consideration.So conversion currency conversion value, conversion time conversion name and the Google click ID thenthis is uploaded to Google Ads, um, which I will show you in a moment.Through the upload section here.And this is where you would upload your source.You can do a Google Sheet.And then you could set it up on a recurring schedule so that when you update this Google sheet, um,every let's say you, you're uploading it every day, multiple times a day.As your information is coming through.You can set this up automatically, let's say through Zapier, syncing up with your CRM.so when a form fill comes through with a Google click ID associated with it, add the conversion timestamp,add the Google click ID, add the conversion name that's associated with it.Whatever it is, you can set that all up through Zapier, or you can manually fill out the sheet, whichis a bit more complex.Um, then this gets sent into Google.Um, if you set it on a recurring schedule, let's say every 8 a.m., this gets added.Um, and then you're going to create a conversion action to use that upload, convert that uploadeddata.The upload conversion data, um, as the um, conversion action.Okay.So we talked through that.You need to be able to track the Google click ID, um, add it to a Google Sheet, import that and uploadit to um, Google ads, then create a conversion action that's taking that uploaded information andcreated an action for it, or you already have an action associated with it and you're adding to it.Okay.So this is what it would look like when you start creating that conversion action.Um, when you click the import button, you can do track conversions from clicks.And you, you associate it with with that data that you have the data source, um, connecting thatdata source from the Google Sheet or somewhere else.Okay.The in order to get the G cloud into either your CRM or wherever you're tracking it, um, let's sayfor a form fill for example.So you need to add the g cloud.You need to add a hidden form field for g cloud.So it captures that g cloud That was in the URL when someone searched.So this is an example of the type of code that you would have to add on the form fill side, um, whereit would be called field.And then you put in that it'll dynamically pull in that value for gcloud.Um, but it needs to be a hidden form field so it doesn't actually show up, but it's able to pull fromthe URL.Um, you will need to add a hidden field to your form to capture the gcloud.So you will need back end access or someone a developer that's able to do it.You will also need to update your CRM or any back end to be able to capture that new field.And one other small thing.There's a lot of nuances with this gcloud, but it's good for you to understand the way the trackingworks in general.Um, is that when we have a URL, someone types clicks an ad, and in the URL it says gcloud equalsright?And it's going to put a unique identifier.Now what happens if they leave that URL and they go to a different page?Right.So they got to the contact page and now they want to go check out a blog page.So we lose that information in the URL.So whenever they fill out a form it's not in the URL.So it won't fill out in the form in the in the form field.But if you save that information in the cookie data, which you can do through Google Tag Manager,if you save that information in their cookies, then you'll be able to pull it in.So there's a lot of nuances here, and something that most people end up leaning more towards enhancedconversions for leads, which is more popular nowadays.Um, but it is still, you know, you might come across it in an account, you might want to set itup for various reasons.But here's the overarching way to set it up.Um, you're going to have someone click an ad.There's a G in the URL.You can either save it through cookies, or if it's just one single landing page and no one can clickaround anywhere else.Um, then you have that form will actually be able to capture that information, um, put it into theCRM, then in the CRM, when that offline conversion happens, you time stamp it, you add the conversionname that you want associated with it, and then that information and the value associated.And then that all gets added back to Google Ads.If it was actually a valuable lead or whatever you want to track if it's only qualified leads.Right.So there's different ways to go about it.That's offline conversion tracking.Um, this is where you would upload your offline conversion data with those spreadsheets, which I showedyou before.Um, you could do it through Zapier.Zapier will automatically, you know, you can set it up to pull automatically the information you need.Use Google templates.You're going to create a scheduled upload.Also, um, and that is offline conversion tracking with gcloud.There's one last piece I want to show you.So in the conversion actions what this looks like.So you have your conversion goal.It's going to say the source is import from clicks because we we set that up here.There's no data integration because we're not using a direct um source like um, Zapier or you know,one of these other Salesforce solutions, for example.But you can see it says you can manually upload a file from conversions.Um, you go to the upload section and that's where you can have it on recurring schedule, and it willautomatically be updating that information as that template.And that spreadsheet is updated.So you have or you can do it through Google Sheets here.It's up to you, um, how you want to do it.But you essentially have a specific conversion action that the source is imports from clicks.And that's where your, um, setting that up.
