# 20.31 Keyword Organization- Using Mergewords to Generate Keyword Lists

Howdy, Edwards fans.And welcome back.In this lecture, I'm going to walk you through a couple of my favorite go to tools that helps you buildout key word lists much faster and much more efficiently, all this match type for formatting, etc.It allows you to do this really quickly.So the first thing is merge words and we've saw this tool briefly, but I want to show it to you again.So head over to merge words and you see these three boxes in front of you as it says merge where it'sfast and easy for Google AdWords, whatever.And there's a couple of cool things you could do.So say we were doing this office chairs, office chairs campaign.So we had a lot of our basic themes that we started off with, right?We know we wanted ergonomic.So you put those in the first box and if you're doing service businesses, it would be the same thing.And you basically figure out how to break this down and how to structure, structure, structure thisfor your own ad group lists.Agronomic.Rolling, colorful.White is too leather.Let's do plastic.Modern computer.Computer.What else do we have?We had wheeled swivel.Executive.Executive.Lumbar support.Uh.High end.Sit to stand, standing, kneeling.All right, so we have a bunch, right?So these are some of our ad groups.And then we would have we would say, okay, we want to have ergonomic, followed by what word rolling,followed by what word making combinations of all the possible variants.So we would put in share, right.So it would be ergonomic chair, rolling chair, colorful chair.But you could add more in the second column.So let's say I would do desk chair, right?I could do two words in a column.So this so this would now output me 32 possible combinations would be all of these plus the first wordin this middle column and all these plus the second word in the middle column.So I'd have ergonomic chair, ergonomic desk chair, rolling chair, rolling desk chair, colorful chair,colorful desk chair.So now say I do office chair and I could do seating.Office seating.Now, when I emerge all these words, I'll have white chair.White desk chair.White office chair.White seating.White office seating.Modern chair.Modern desk, modern office, so on and so forth.And it shows me 96 possible combinations where I can go even further.I could add a third combination.I can add a third modifier term, so I could do ergonomic chair.Maybe I would want to do add in for sale, maybe I want to do discount, maybe I want to do cheap,maybe I want to do online, maybe I'll do coupons.We want to see deals, right?So now I have I jumped from just 100 or so combinations to 672 to 672 combinations.Because now I'm going to have ergonomic chair, ergonomic desk chair, ergonomic office chair, ergonomicseating, ergonomic chair for sale, ergonomic chair discount ergonomic chair cheap ergonomic desk chairfor sale discount cheap.You see how this works?I get tons of combinations and it just takes you a few seconds and you can set this all up.Well, if I click Merge, I now have an output of those 672 keywords.Right.Incredible.It just takes a few seconds.And if you have a good sense of your research and a good sense of organization, you could use to likethis incredibly quickly and you could copy and paste this right back into Google ads.So I'll show that.I'll show that to you in a second.But what about if I want to deal with my match types?Well, if I click on extra options, here's where things get awesome.I could wrap everything I could.I could have a separator as a plus sign, which gives me everything in broad match modified.I can wrap everything in a phrase with, with and just put a space in and just put everything in quotations,which gives me everything in phrase match.And I could do that as well with brackets for exact match, incredibly powerful tool.So say I was going into my AdWords account and I was in my office chairs campaign, I'm in ergonomicand I go into ergonomic, I go to keywords and I click the blue plus sign to add more keywords, right?I could literally add, let's say I want to do first wrap them and nothing and just do my broad matchmodified.So I have 672 here.I'm going to copy paste them in.Now, remember, because merge words takes every variation.You're going to want to go ahead and remove the individual keywords that will come up so you can justscroll through and remove just a plus standing and be careful to do that.So it's not going to be a perfect, perfect output set to stand by itself.And let's say imagine we do that.And then I can go back to merge words and I could take a space between each word and have my exact matchversion and click merge and I can just command all or control all command c control C to copy and pastethem by command control V And again, you want to remove those individual words.So now I have 1300 or so keywords that I've added really quickly into that, into that ergonomic ADDgroup.Now, of course, I'm going to cancel that because we have to remember that these are not only for myergonomic ADD group, right?So if I want to just build them out by a group, I could remove all of these.Except for aerodynamic.And now instead of 700, we have we have 42 combinations.But if I merge them, I now have all my ergonomic keywords and I can remove the word ergonomic by itselfright there.I can copy and paste.And then I could do that same four phrase match, copy and paste, and I could do the same for broadmatch, modified copy and paste and then just space for just broad match copy and paste.Right.So I have around 160 or so, 170 keywords for my ergonomic ADD group, and then I can adjust my bidsindividually once they're in Google ads.So Merge Words is an incredibly powerful, incredibly quick tool.If you need to quickly build keyword lists, you can do it with match types.I could choose to just use a two core combination.So ergonomic chair, six combinations and I have my six keywords right there.It's fantastic.That's merge words.The other one, the other one I want to show you, which is not a combination tool, it's a tool formatch types.It's specifically it's called AdWords wrapper dot com AdWords wrapper dot com.It's free tool to use.Scroll down and you enter in a bunch of keywords.So let's go back into merge words and get a bunch of keywords.So Sabre to do rolling and swivel and wheeled and we do let's say desk chair, chair, office chair.Computer chair.Computer seat seeding whatever 18 combinations and I merge them and they're all broad match.So let's say, I mean if you're doing this in a merge word, you could do your wrapping there.But say I were let's say I were doing this in Excel or I downloaded or I was copying and pasting fromGoogle Keyword Planner or I was doing using M Rush.I can go over to AdWords wrapper, pasting a list of a bunch of keywords and I could wrap them justclick wrap keywords.And if you scroll down, I have an output.So I have my I have a few different outputs.I have broad modified broad phrase and exact match.This is all the match types for those keywords and I can copy and paste all of these.Into Google ads by going to keywords.And if I paste, you'll see that they all have the match types already apply to them.Right?Really, really cool.I could also take an output of modified phrase in exact phrase, in exact broad phrase and exact modifiedbroad by itself, phrase by itself and exact by itself.And it wraps all the different combinations of your base list over here.So this is a really cool tool.If you have a list or a client sends you over a list of locations or whatever it may be, and you wantit to modify the terms.You want to wrap them in phrase an exact and broad match modified.You quickly throw them into here, you wrap the keywords you copy and paste them back into Google ads.So these are two of my favorite, favorite tools for quickly wrapping keywords and also getting longcomprehensive lists of merged words using your your root word and these additional modifier words usingmerge words.I want to show you one more cool, cool tool.It's called Speed, PPC.Now ABC.com or PPC, it's its own software.It's quite a big software.There's a lot you could do with it.You need to use it in conjunction with AdWords Editor, which is a cool software and we've mentionedAdWords editor in the past.It's not something that I use often, but if you're building massive accounts and I mean hundreds ifnot thousands of campaigns with thousands of ad groups, and it's extremely rare that you should dothis, then you could find a lot of value in a tool like Speed.PPC This came up recently for us when we were dealing with a company that sells eyeglasses and sunglassesonline, and we're dealing with hundreds of brands, tens of thousands of model numbers, which is anoutput of over the course of the account, literally millions of keywords, keywords in the millionsacross.Lots and lots of different campaigns and ad groups.And we built those out very quickly because we wanted to use brand and model number of combinationsfor thousands of SKUs.And to use a company like Speed PPC, you log in, you could create dynamic and very specific ad copyand very, very specific outputs of ad groups.And you could copy and paste all that into AdWords editor and from AdWords editor, you could uploadthem into Google ads.So it's a cool tool.So if you want to if you're if you're in that sort of market where you're dealing with keyword listsin the hundreds of thousands at a very, very high scale, then definitely check out speed PPC.I think it's like 70 bucks a month or something like that.Again, I'm not affiliated with them, I don't know them.I don't get paid to refer you to them.It's a tool that I've been using for over the last four or five years at least.And I don't know, like once or twice a year I think it comes up with a that type of client that thiswould be good for, but for quick keyword building AdWords wrapper, merge words, but then nothingreally beats the organization you get in Excel.And from Excel, of course, it's also easy to copy and paste keywords back into Google ads.So if I open up, excel again and say our to take my ergonomic aggregate keywords and I could filterout again by my the keywords that I'm focusing on or the aggregate that I focus on if I want to lookfor.Work at first focused buy first filter out by campaign.Let's say I'm looking at office chairs only and then I can look at my ad groups and I'm only lookingfor ergonomic.So I have my keywords.So I could take these keywords.Copy them.Go back into AdWords, click the plus sign.Once I go into that specific ad group, or I can go into the campaign at the high level, go to keyword,still, click the plus sign, and then I just have to select the groups.I would select ergonomic and simply paste click Save.And we'd be good to go google red the match type formatted uploaded and now it's part of that campaignI can go into, let's say, rolling.I can go back into Excel.I can look for that ad group.And so I would select Ergonomic.And we actually don't have rolling because that wasn't one of the main themes that we created.But let's just pretend it was the modern.I would take those keywords.Again, highlight command or control, see back into AdWords and go into that ad group and paste thosein.And now I'm expanding my keywords.We haven't dealt with bids, and that's a big question that I get, but.We've spent at least a couple of hours, right, talking about keywords.We went through keyword planning and keyword research and keyword organization, all the different keywordtools and match types and concepts and negative keywords and traffic sculpting.You guys, I appreciate the patience.I know sometimes I'm repetitive.Hope for those of you who are getting these concepts, you could be watching this set at 1.5 speed orwhatever, but you should feel proud that you have a really, really deep and strong foundation andknowledge of all things keywords related.In Google ads.You understand how they are structured, you understand how important they are, you understand howmuch control you have using match types.You understand how they could be used with different bidding strategies.Most importantly, you understand the psychology of search.You understand how people talk to search engines.You understand what you as an advertiser can extract from what a person uses in their search term tosee if this is a keyword that's going to be a bottom of the funnel keyword a top of the funnel, keyworda medium of the funnel keyword.Is this going to be a high value keyword?Is it going to be a high traffic keyword?Are my competitors bidding on this keyword?Are my competitors generating a lot of volume, a high percentage of volume to their campaigns, totheir to their website?From this keyword, how do I want to systematically set up my themes?How do I want to break out my ad groups?What type of content?How does it line up with the different content I have on my website?Am I missing content on my website?All this stuff comes together, right?We still haven't talked about a lot to do with Google ads like conversion tracking and optimizationstrategies and and formulas for calculating profitability and and auditing an account that has a lotof data and finding where things are going wrong and what could be improved and quality score and howthe AdWords auction works.But the fundamentals are there.You understand how to set up a campaign, you understand keywords, and that's something you shouldbe excited about.So without rambling on any further, I will see you guys in the very next lecture where I attempt toteach you how to predict and set up what your initial max CPC bids should be at the keyword level orat the aggregate level for campaigns in situations where it's hard to do so because you don't have historicdata.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon and the very next lecture.
