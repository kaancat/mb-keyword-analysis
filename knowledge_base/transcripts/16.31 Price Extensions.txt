# 16.31 Price Extensions

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.Let's talk about price extensions, which is my second favorite type of extension outside of promotionextensions.I say it's my favorite because I love all the extra information that you can get in it.But I still would say signing extensions reigns supreme with the amount of options you're giving theuser, allowing them to self identify what they want to do, giving more space.But price extensions are fantastic.We quickly looked at a price extension before, but just take a look at again at this website.This website frame is by mail under here picture frames from 1368.If I click on more, I get a couple more additional products, I could go and click on the specificlink.I could see pricing again, similar to promotion extensions, you're creating this pseudo shopping adexperience inside text ads, which is fantastic.And look how much information I can get about a product before frames by mail ever gets charged a centfrom Google for the advertising campaigns, it's really fantastic.So let's go into.Google ads and set up price extensions.So I'm going to twirl that down, see my familiar window and click new price extension.There's a few different options we need to configure.So first we configure our language, which of course will keep in English for us and the type of priceextension, the top level category of what we're doing, of what we're of, what we're going to be listing.So by default it shows brands.But I also have events.So let's say I'm a company that that puts on events or seminars or shows or concerts that I might saythese are the events that are that are coming up.Locations.Maybe I'm a real estate broker and I service different locations.Maybe I want to list a neighborhoods because I'm a spa or masseuse or something like that.And I travel or my company services a number of different neighborhoods and and I might have separatepricing per neighborhood.Right.So that's another reason why I might use neighborhoods.Again, product categories, that's an obvious one.So let's say for and I might use product categories, desk chair starting from this amount, file cabinetsstarting from this price.And it's really good for people to see price.That's the beauty of price extensions.That's the number one thing because you're allowing people to either realize that it's too expensivefor me, like maybe this product is too expensive.It's not really what I'm looking for or like, this is much cheaper.It's clearly not what I'm looking for, right?So if a person could see the price of a product or the range of prices before they click, you mightactually save a lot of money in the past.Way back when, when I first recorded this course, I used to tell people like a really great techniquewas to put the price of the product in the headline.And it was true and it's still sort of true because that allowed you to deter people from clicking onyour ad that are not going to be customers.Again, the point is not to just get a high click through rate.The point is, is not to just get clicks on your ads.The point is to get clicks from people who are going to ultimately generate profit or get clicks forpeople who are likely to ultimate ultimately generate a profit.So if a person is searching for office chairs and let's say I'm searching and I know that I want I knowthat I want a really good office chair, it's going to cost me 600 bucks.And I see an ad showing me like 3000 executive leather chairs then I don't want that.I'm not going to click on that ad.I might also see an ad for Staples offering a $70 out of the box office chair, and I know I don't wantthat.So in both cases, the expensive furniture company and Staples doesn't have to pay for my click becausethey were smart enough to show me the price.But now with promotion and specifically price extensions, you actually have the opportunity to specificallyshow pricing for products and product categories and for all different sorts of categories in the adwithout having to use that space in the headline.So product tiers, service categories, maybe again, I'm a house cleaning company or I'm a spa or I'ma gym and I offer different service categories that start at different prices, service tiers and maybethe bronze gold, maybe, maybe I'm a company that offers web hosting, right?Or I'm a company that offers website templates and I have different tiers.I have the bronze package, I have the gold package of the premium package, different pricing or justoverall services.Right?I offer consulting, I offer graphic design, I offer advertising management.You know, any service business could could all take our client in Las Vegas that offers the hydrationtherapy.So I might offer services for beauty, for hangover, for skin treatment, you know, and then I couldsay the pricing starting for each one of those, and that's actually a price extension we use in forthat client.And it works out very well and we've seen a lift and click through rate and a decrease in cost per clickas we've added on price extensions over time.So you set up a header.So let's say four poppin office chairs.We're going to we have our brands and our quality extensions or we had a structure, maybe our structuredsnippet extension was for brands, but we want to really focus on price here.So maybe I would focus on product categories because we want to identify poppin is in a is in a it'sin a space, it operates in a vertical that has a wide range of pricing.Right?You have really cheap office furniture, you have extraordinarily expensive office furniture.So it's great to carve out who we are.So I'm going to choose product categories and then I'm going to choose my currency in US dollars pricequalifier.So we're going to do from because we're choosing price categories, we have a range of products in eachcategory.So it will be from a certain price you could right up to average or no qualifier, just the actual priceof a of a service or a service tier or a package or a neighborhood or whatever that might be.So our price qualifier will be from and now we're going to go and add our first item.So I'm going to say something like office chairs.I'd like to write a title case when I'm doing headers.Office chairs from 299 and I could choose units in case I needed to do that.That's not applicable for us.But let's say I was talking about consulting or I was talking about a spa appointment, or I'm talkingabout something else that is hourly or daily, weekly, monthly, nightly.If I'm a hotel and I'm offering the cost of a hotel room, I would be per night from 209 per night,but for us is just from 299 for office because it's obvious that it's just for the office chair.I could write a description,choose from a range of colors too much.Colorful.Fun and comfortable.Something like that.Or color, fun, comfort.So you don't need to be overly concerned with your description for your for your price extensions,because most of the time the descriptions don't actually show up and you don't need to really have somuch copy for that.And then I would have a final URL.So I would go to my I would go back to Poppin and I would find my furniture and I would find my officechair is top level category because that's where I'd be sending them and I'd simply paste that in andI could choose a separate mobile URL if you had a separate mobile URL.But we don't need to do that because we don't have a separate mobile URL and most websites don't.And then I would add another price extension item, so I might do something like file cabinets.From $99.I could write a description.I'm not going do that now, just for the sake of time.I'll find my file cabinets, top level domain, and I'll paste it in this price extension for.I actually had to refresh this for file cabinets reset from 9 to $9.I'll make another one.We'll call this.Let's see.Maybe we'll do tables.And I'll say office.Tables from 599.If that's if that's what it was, I could write a description, put in a final URL for a conferencetable.Or maybe I'll take that.It should be.Conference tables and then I only want to do three or four.I could delete additional one so I could delete one that they give me in default.I could add one more if I delete it too.I could always add add a price extension item and then that will give me the option to to create anotherheader.And let's say I want to do corporate branding and find the corporate branding top level.Corporate branding from, let's say, its $19 minimum order.Put a final URL and great.So now I can twirl these all up and let's watch what I could do.First, I want to preview and show you what it looks like as a preview.So pretty neat on a mobile device.This is what it would look like.I could scroll through.I have a description of a headline.I have a display.All right.And look at it.This is massive amount of real estate.And I could click each one and go to that section of the site.It's like super, super helpful.When you get a price extension, you're almost guaranteed to get the click because it's so useful.You have so much information that person could really identify this is what they want.And if we look at what it might look like on a desktop, again, lots of information.And I was showing you a couple of seconds ago.A price extension for picture frames or that or frames the frames by mail frames direct and it lookeda little bit different.Google's constantly testing and changing minor adjustments to the format of how certain extensions actuallyshow up.But this is a basic idea of what it might look like.So it's really, really it's a really serious expansion of the size of your ad.It gives really useful information.And now that I think about it more honestly, I was I was prepared to double down on my slightly slightlyextensions being the best.This might be even better because you are also giving people the option of going to a specific areaof the site.It's organized data.You could have a description, you have a specific price.You can write whether they're from you.It's you could you could put a whole bunch of people could scroll through.It's a really, really good type of extension.You should use it.And again, this is the type of extension, unlike location extensions, any business could use it.You guys, I, I was going through some of my clients and, and I could not think of a single clientthat we cannot use a, a price extension for everyone.Sell something and maybe not in every campaign you might have a campaign that's generating newslettersignups or whatever it is.But everyone thinks everybody ultimately ultimately sells something and you could almost always fitwhat you sell into one of these into one of these predetermined type qualifiers.And if it's not perfect, then you could do it like brands.It could be your own label, it could be whatever.Like services.Like services.It's such a broad category.Could be anything.So.It's really, really powerful extension.One cool thing we could do is we could we could flip this around.So let's say I want corporate branding, I want to push corporate branding.I could drag that and drag it up.And if I look at preview again, corporate branding is going to come first.So I'll have the most visual prominence and then I could go back in order of sort of which servicesor which neighborhoods or which events I want to promote and I could drag and reorder them.So you don't need to worry about setting them up in the order you want them in right away.So the URL options, again, we have the tracking template if you want to add specific tracking froma service outside of Google Analytics.If you're using Google Analytics, which most most of you are, you don't need to worry about the trackingtemplate.I'll touch base on the tracking template in a couple lectures and then advanced options again.I can have start and end dates to my price extensions and specific schedules, as we've seen with almostall the other ADD extension formats.So that's price extensions.Absolutely.Use them, implement them and make as many of them as you can because again, all the different anythingyou could do to get an edge on your your competition is worthwhile to do.And these types of add extensions are certainly very, very important in having larger ads increasingyour click the rate, increasing quality score and letting users determine whether or not you're theright vendor or company or brand to explore today.Because remember, if they choose that they want to click on your ad or click on an extension or clickon a site link, it's going to cost you money.So you want to make sure that that money is being spent as efficiently as possible.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the next lecture where we talk about finally ad rotation.This is it for extensions we've been through.We went through in detail all the different extensions that they offer.And we'll talk about briefly ad rotation and we'll be just about done with creating our very first campaign.And when you go and do it, the next time is going to take you 5 minutes, not a few hours.I look forward to see you guys very soon in a couple of seconds.
