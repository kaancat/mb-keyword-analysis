# 10.7 Common Search Campaign Questions

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to go through a list of common search campaign questions that we get.I think many of you will be facing some of these questions from clients or have these questions yourself.So let's run through them one by one.Number one, should I be bidding on my competitors terms?This is a question we get all the time.Um, and it's it's a complex topic.And of course, like most complex topics, the answer is it depends.Number one, is there enough search volume.So do you have competitors that that it would even make sense.It's even viable to bid on their on their searches.Oftentimes your competitors are not generating enough search volume.And therefore Google is not going to actually show, um, any of your ads when somebody searches fora competitor term.But in many cases you have a lot of competitors.Maybe some of these competitors are bidding on your terms, and you could go and bid on their terms.Number two, how much is it going to cost to enter these auctions?And number three, are we able to generate impressions and clicks.So impressions is really a function of volume.Clicks is a function of how much are you going to have to bid to be at the top of the page?And is it the type of thing where you could actually divert somebody looking for, um, your, your,your competitor's products, um, divert them to your product.So for example, let's go back to we were talking about coolers and tumblers.Say your Yeti, right.You're like a really big established or I'm sorry, say you're like a small startup competing with Yeti,and you want to search.You want to bid on Yeti's brand name.So somebody searches for Yeti cooler.You want to show an ad for your cooler?Well, you have to understand, Yeti is a really big, established brand.It's very likely that somebody searching for Yeti wants Yeti specifically.So if you don't have a very strong value proposition, um, then it might not make sense to go and bidon their terms, because you might get clicks and those clicks might be expensive.But if you're not really competing, you have to consider that you might be sinking cost into just gettingclicks, but you're not going to generate sales when you think about how much it's going to cost.But okay.But if you're if you're competing, right.So if you have a value proposition, say, hey, we have similar features for half the price, thenthat's a real value proposition.You could target price conscious consumers who are not necessarily looking, or they're so bought intothe brand, and they'll always be sort of a contingency of people like that.Um, I think in service based businesses, especially in local service based businesses, it is a goodidea to bid on competitor terms, because if you could respond faster, if you could be, um, if youcould be, if you could offer a better price, if you could offer better service in general, then oftentimeswith local service based searches, whether it's a trucking company or a laundromat or a locksmith orHVAC repair or pest control or a personal injury attorney.Right?Sometimes people are just looking for a solution, and they're not necessarily, um, they're not reallyas tied to a brand.So with e-commerce luxury goods, there's a lot of brand affinity.And you have to be careful whether or not it makes sense to bid on competitor terms.But with local service businesses, I would say it's it's safer to go and try to generate traffic.Bidding.Bidding on competitor terms.When you think about how much it's going to cost to enter these auctions, the truth is you have tojust test it.You could do some research and get a sense of search volume on competitor terms and average CPCs.You could use Google's Keyword Planner, you could use tools like SEMrush, but those tools are historicallyinaccurate.Um, and it can be very inaccurate.Your campaign, your historic data, your campaign structure and setup, the day to day changes in volume,all of that's going to be, um, all that's going to go and take be taken into account when you actuallysee real time, real world results.So just test it.Take 2 or 3 of your most direct competitors and test a competitor campaigns.A couple of things that I would say if a competitor like sometimes there's sort of a smaller industrywith a fewer big players and there's like a cease fire, you don't bid on my terms, I won't bid onyour terms.And that's something that that is very much a case by case basis.If you see competitors bidding on your terms, like we have a lot of agencies bidding on our searchterms, if you do a search for Adventure Media Group, you're going to see other agencies bidding onus.Look, I take that as a compliment that we're big enough and and present enough.And we we're meaningful enough that a lot of our competitors that used to be much larger than us arenow bidding on our terms.Great.Let them bid on our terms.Doesn't scare me.I don't we don't go so crazy bidding on other competitor terms.Um, it's just not how we really generate the best quality traffic.But if you are going to bid on competitor terms, I would be careful not to not to in any way demeanyour competitors.don't say you're like, these guys are bad or low quality.Um, just talk to your talk to your strengths.Talk to your strengths.One.You're much less likely to get complaints from competitors.And and they can't do anything to stop you.You're allowed to bid on competitor terms.That's just Google's policy.But you just don't want to generate bad will in an in in an industry, you don't want to generate negativewill amongst your competitors.Uh, two.Um, customers don't like it.Like people don't like it.If you're just bashing and putting down and talking badly about your competitors, when you should beusing that time and that space to talk up positively about your value proposition.All right.So that's that's how I think about bidding on competitor terms.Here's a great question.What budget should I allocate to my search campaign.That's a question we get all the time.And the key considerations around setting budget are your business size, goals, and industry competition.Start with a modest budget and adjust based on performance data.Um, again, what is a modest budget?A good rule of thumb is around five times your target CPA as a daily budget.So if you're bidding for conversions for form submissions and you're willing to get and you'd like toget form submissions at a $40 CPA or so, then aim for a $200 a day budget.Now, if $200 a day is too high, it's okay.Start with a $50 or $40 a day budget.I would not recommend launching any campaigns at a lower budget than you're willing to pay for a conversion,because then you're not even allowing Google to get you one conversion.If there's a search campaign running with historical data.So if you have historic data from other campaigns, analyze those metrics to understand conversion rate,click through rate.The competitive landscape and then build your projections and expected results based on those historicalmetrics.So historic data is the best, most effective way of getting a sense of what I could be bidding on,what my search campaign budget should be to start with in a new search campaign, so I'll understandmy historic conversion rates if I'm spending $500.What?How much traffic am I going to get to my site?Right?What is my general click through rate?Has it been in the 1 to 2 or 3%?Is it 10 to 15%?Like that's going to be very specific to a business of those clicks.Who's converting.So there's no there's no best practice here.There's no way for me to tell you now what you should be setting as your daily budget.It all very much depends on what you're looking to accomplish, the size of your business, um, andso on.However, I would say this, you should be able to lose for a month the entire daily budget And nothave negative, drastically negative consequences to your business.Okay.That's that's a perspective.So for example, if your daily budget is $100, that's going to put you on a $3,000 spend trajectoryfor the month, if you like, you should be able to lose $3,000 right now.And your business can be fine.Like you'll sleep tonight.That doesn't mean you're going to lose the entire budget, right?So if you're starting a brand new campaign and your budget is $500, you should be able to lose $15,000today and your business will survive and you'll be okay.That's a good way of thinking about daily budget, right?So if you're we just signed a big billion dollar company called Zeiss.Zeiss makes lenses.Glass.Most, most SLR professional cameras have.You'll see Zeiss in the lens they make.They make lenses for regular glasses.Okay.So like, they could spend they could spend $25 million and not lose sleep.Now, that doesn't mean that that should be their budget either.But as a as a as a minimum threshold, we need to know, like if this doesn't work out and we don'tget any conversions for a month, are we safe?So that's a good conservative perspective on on setting budgets for a new search campaign.How can seasonal trends affect my search campaigns?So you are likely in a business where seasonality impacts the business.Like for example, as as us as an agency, summer is really slow because key decision makers at largercompanies are away.They're not making big decisions, especially now going into Q3, Q4, Q4 has a massive impact on one-commerce businesses.You have Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, um, end of year sales, right?It's like Q4 is a big Christmas Hanukkah.You have it's like really big.Q4 is a really big.Shopping is the biggest shopping period of the year.So we're going to see higher click through rates.We're going to see higher conversion rates.We're going to see higher average average order values if you sell summer dresses right.That's a seasonality factor.Um, so how do you address seasonality changes in performance when you're setting up a Google campaign?So number one is you really do need to adjust your campaigns to align with seasonal trends and the consumerbehavior you're expecting to see.Monitor your performance.If you don't understand or yet or know your seasonality, it changes how clickthrough rate and conversionrate and average order value change with the seasons and seasons doesn't necessarily mean weather.It could mean weather.It could mean period of year.It could be.It could be big weekend.It could be Labor Day weekend.Adjust and optimize your bids and budgets during peak periods to capitalize on an increase in demand.So if you're going into Labor Day weekend, you know that you sell electronics and it's a big day andyou're running a 20% sale.Make sure you're adjusting your daily budget so you can capture more of that traffic.And lastly, use a seasonality bid adjustment to kickstart the system.This is really important.Google has a feature called seasonality bid adjustments, where Google optimizes based on what theyexpect your conversion rate to be right.So if you're using value based bidding or conversion based bidding, Google is going to be setting bidsfor you in the auction based on what they anticipate conversion rate being because your conversion rateis what impacts your revenue.So if so, I'm spending $100 on ads, right?I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting 100 clicks for a dollar a click.Now what does Google.And that might be a dollar a click average.But some of those clicks are going to be $3.Some of those clicks are going to be $0.40.Google is going to be moderating those bids based on what they think.My total value from that click is going to be, which is going to be impacted by conversion rate.So out of those 100 clicks, how much money am I making?Well, it depends on what is your predicted conversion rate.Now Google doesn't necessarily know if next week my conversion rate is going to shoot up because I'mgoing to be running a sale.Google doesn't know I'm going to be running that sale, or running a discount code or promotion, orLabor Day has such an impact.So I have to go into Google and say, here's a seasonality bid adjustment.I'm going to lower my Roas threshold.I'm going to lower my target CPA threshold.Right?I'm going to I'm going to give Google these signals that I'm anticipating a higher conversion rate overthis period of time, and therefore Google will bid not based on what they know historically about myconversion rate.Google is going to bid based on what I'm telling them.My conversion rate is going to be.So really use the seasonality bid adjustment system.It's a really, really important tool.It's a really underutilized tool.And it's one of the tools that is, I would say is is one of our secret weapons when optimizing, especiallye-commerce campaigns, where seasonality really does make a strong impact.What strategies should I use to optimize for high quality leads rather than just getting leads and clicks?Right.So I want to address quality of leads.So this is very specific to lead gen.Um, there's again we could have a huge wide gamut of of potential prospects, a prospect paying me$1,000, $5000 to $1 million.Right.There's whatever your business is if you're in lead gen, right?We all know that there's a range of quality.The most important thing to do here is to close the feedback loop with machine learning, so they canoptimize for high quality leads.So in this case, Google is the machine your CRM, whether it's HubSpot, Salesforce, a Google Sheet,something has to be tracking the leads that come through and all of the different stages that take placeto close.We have we have a large drug drug rehab center that, that that we've closed the feedback loop for.We have a large culinary institution that we've closed the feedback loop for.A lead comes in, and now there's like 15 or 20 more things that have to happen.Well, there's a verification of benefits.There's an insurance, um, application.There's qualifications, there's getting on a call, there's being sent a proposal, there's gettingthe proposal signed, there's getting transfers in place.Right.Those are more complex, um, situations.But even in a general lead gen business, whether you're a pest control company or you're a truckingcompany or you're an agency, there's some things that happen.So the best way to to optimize for quality is for you to track those stages in your CRM.So, for example, if you're an agency, the lead comes in.Well, we assign a we, we assign a score to that lead just by looking at the website and the and theand the message and the form.Maybe on a 1 to 10 scale, we assign we, we assign a value.Um, then we say, okay, did it become an SQL sales qualified lead based on scheduling an appointmentor scheduling a an audit call?Um, and then we we send that data back to Google.Google now will know that a lead that came in four days ago.This conversion that came in four days ago is now an SQL and that has a certain value assigned to it.And then if in a week from now or two weeks or a month from now, that lead closes into a won opportunity,and that's a $10,000 deal, I'm going to send that value and that deal stage back to Google as a conversionaction.Google over time is going to learn, and this will take time.If you're generating 1015 of these a day, it'll take less time.If you're generating 5 to 6 of these deals a month, it's going to take more time.But over time, and this might be a year out, I've seen campaigns that optimized.It took 3 or 4 years to get to a point where it's like, wow, Google really can send high quality leads.So that's the the idea of closing the feedback loop.When Google understands that this lead that they sent is $5,000 of value.And Google understands that this other lead is ten and this other lead is $50,000 of value.Google is going to start understanding what makes the $50,000 $10,000 leads similar.What is the common denominator that runs between them.And they're going to again match that up with their all of their signals, their behavioral profilesof these people so they can better predict when they bid for a new user.Who do we think this user is?Who do we think this user is?Is this user part of the lower quality cohort or a higher quality cohort or a mid-range quality cohort?And Google is going to bid appropriately.That's the first thing.Closing the feedback loop.Second, focus on targeting high intent keywords.This is a simple thing, right?But it's something that is often overlooked because now we get so caught up in bidding strategies weforget about our keyword strategy.High intent keywords are people who are using industry jargon, language acronyms, model numbers.Right?Like those are things that that that can indicate a certain level of sophistication around your services,around your products, that by, as a proxy, can be used to to predict lead quality, use negativekeywords to filter out irrelevant traffic.Right.So if you're really if you're really struggling in your campaigns with a healthy volume of leads, butjust low quality leads, that's when you want to get into, um, a more nuanced negative keyword strategy.And of course, optimize your landing pages for conversions to attract quality leads.Um, landing pages and on site copy and structure is the most overlooked function because we get soexcited and almost like addicted to the Google ecosystem of acquisition, of just buying traffic, buyingtraffic, buying traffic.We forget that what we say on the landing page is what we say on our website.How our information is structured, um, can really impact whether or not we actually get a lead toclose or a quality lead to close.We had this for ourselves for, for, for years.We were generating 200 agency leads a month, but they were in high quality and we did a lot of thingsin the campaigns and nothing worked.But then we realized that, hey, we're giving off a presentation and a vibe on our site that we workwith certain types of businesses and that we wouldn't be a good fit for larger businesses.And we embarked on an expensive, time consuming, painful web redesign ordeal where we really showcasedour best work, where we elevated the elegance of our site, where we enhanced and refined our communication,and we catered our copy to more sophisticated mid-market, larger businesses, and our lead qualityincreased.We have an entire course about landing page design optimization, and I definitely encourage you todig into some of that content to learn some of these strategies around clarifying your copy, cateringyour copy, production quality, etc. and so on.But, um, it's a starting point.Definitely consider your landing pages.What is the expected return on investment for a search campaign in my industry?We get this from clients all the time, right?If I'm spending $500 a day, how much do I should I get back in returns?And there is no answer to this question because unless you actually begin running campaigns, you'renever going to know what the return on ad spend or the ROI is going to be.However, you can give benchmarks.You can analyze industry benchmarks.You could use tools like Statista, eMarketer, ChatGPT research.GPT is a great one, which I've been using a lot lately.Um, and you can look at historic data from your campaigns to estimate ROI.Always set realistic expectations.Of course, it goes without saying.You have to optimize campaign performance all the time.But but you always want to be setting realistic expectations.So I show clients usually a range.I say here's the conservative, here's the expected and here's an aggressive potential outcomes.And this is based on either historic data from from the campaigns.That's the best data to use.And if I can marry it and enhance it with data from Statista.eMarketer.ChatGPT or research GPT and get a sense of like, look, we're definitely not getting a 10% conversionrate for this type of business.We're not good, but we don't want to have a 0.5% conversion rate.So like 3% is maybe where we're going to go where we think is realistic and at a 3% conversion rate,if your average order value your lifetime revenue per customer or whatever information you're able toget from your client, if that is accurate, if that stays the same and our clicks cost within 3 to$5 a click, that's enough information to give me a ballpark understanding of ROI.Now, for our larger, more sophisticated clients who are who want us to incorporate overhead and fixedexpenses and variable costs, all of that additional information can be built into a model.But when a client says, if I'm spending $500 on Google, how much can I expect to return?Every day?You say, let's take a step back, because a, there's no way to know that for sure.There's no because conversion rates vary wildly.Your revenue from deals and products vary wildly.Your click through rate is going to going to going to be a factor.Your CPCs are going to be a factor.Your the how saturated certain markets are going to be a factor.The keywords we're targeting are going to be a factor.All the different bit adjustments and bit strategies we use are going to be a factor, but we can goand build some benchmarks where we think success will be where where we think if we could generate theseresults, if we could generate this type of return, this would be success below that would be we'renot doing well enough.And above that, we probably have more head space to increase budget and try to scale.That's the approach.To answer this type of question, sometimes you're going to get a suggestion from Google to remove redundantkeywords.There might be a couple of keywords popping up in different campaigns and ad groups.Um, and you might wonder, should I remove those redundant keywords because you have the same keywordin multiple ad groups, same keyword in multiple campaigns, and in general, you could you could ignorethis.Um, but here's a way to sort of think through this.A reason to keep keywords right is if you're creating relevant ads and landing pages.So you might have, um, the same keywords showing up in multiple ad groups, but it's relevant.And the landing page is relevant in both those ad groups.Even if even if those two ad groups are testing different strategies.So you might have an ad group that's testing a certain bid strategy.You might have a campaign with a certain budget.Right.There might be a lot of considerations why it does make sense for you to keep redundant keywords.But in general, if you are seeing redundant keywords throughout your your your campaign, you wantto check to make sure that it it should be there.Because oftentimes people you're duplicating ad groups, you're duplicating campaigns as a way to setup a campaign, a larger account quickly, and you'll find that you forgot to pause certain ad groupswhere you might have, um, a keyword for children's bicycles in a, in a, in an adult bicycles adgroup.And that children's bicycle keyword really should be paused.So make sure that your keywords are actually relevant to the ads and the landing pages associated withthat ad group.That's going to that's going to make sure you maintain healthy click through rates.Now, risks of removing keywords.It could lead to irrelevant ad groups lowering click through rates and conversions.Right.So if those if those redundant keywords really are supposed to be in that ad group, then just acceptingthat suggestion could mess up the structure and the relevancy of a specific ad group.Um, with Pmax and we're going to talk a lot more.We're going to talk about Pmax in much more detail.So Pmax, which uses broader targeting, it's not really closely tied to specific keywords.Google decides when and how to show ads.So redundant keywords that's not really relevant or an issue within the Pmax ecosystem.Maintaining control without specific keywords.Google controls ad serving, and that could result in poorly matched ads and landing pages.Right.So you want to make sure that that even within an ad group, right.You have you could have redundant keywords.You could have you could have you could have like 20 keywords.Google will call some of them redundant because they might all trigger similar search terms.But you want I think I think in general what we've seen is the more specific keywords you can have inan ad group to a point, right?You don't you don't need to have a list of 100 similar keywords, but a list of ten keywords that aresort of the same thing but have different nice little different variations.Um, that's a good way of maintaining some more control, especially if you're using broad match keywords.So top a top advertisers strategy, um, adding more keywords for better control.Like I think that's like something which is, is is has greatly enhanced our capacity to like, havebetter than average search campaigns and precise keywords.If if I have a keyword that's precisely matched to a search term, I'm going to have a higher qualityscore.It's going to improve my ad relevancy scores.It's going to improve the user experience.I'm going to potentially be able to use dynamic keyword insertion.Remember we spoke earlier about dynamic keyword insertion.And by and large the idea of redundant keywords is not a problem.So that's a warning that a lot of people get afraid of.But it's something that you could definitely, um, ignore.Here's another big question can I push more budget in my search campaign?Can I spend more money?Can I scale?Well, it again, it depends, but let's take a look at a chart or a decision tree that will help usget a get a wrap our heads around this a little bit.Say I have a 10,000 impressions.I have 500 clicks and I have 45 conversions.Okay, that's the scenario.And I see in my columns, in my reporting, I have a 40% search impression share.Well, that means that I should be able to increase budget.Right?Because I'm only getting I'm only generating 40%.I'm only showing up.My ads are only showing up 40% of the time that I should be eligible to show up.I'm missing out on 60% of the traffic.And I've.And I've entered into 25,000 auctions.Right.So I have, um, many more auctions.I have another 35, whatever, 35,000 auctions that perhaps I'm missing out on.But you need to look at under search impression share.Why?Why am I missing out on these auctions?So then I might look at my columns.Search impression share loss due to budget 40%.Search impression share lost due to rank 20%.So these are two different things.If I'm losing impression share due to rank, that means it's not necessarily a money issue.It's not necessarily a daily budget issue.It's that my quality score or my bids are too low.So therefore my ad rank is falling below the competitive threshold to show up, in which case I wouldneed to increase my bids.So if I'm manual bidding, I need to increase my manual bids.If I'm running target Roas, maybe I'm giving Google too aggressive of a target Roas.I'm telling Google I want a thousand times return.Maybe you need to have a 200% return or a 150% return.Or like most I would say, long term successful campaigns are breaking even on acquiring their firstcustomer.Getting that first lead.So maybe it's a 100% return.And of course, this is all impacted by the values you've applied to different stages in your in yourfunnel for lead gen.But at a high level, if you're losing search impression share due to rank, you have to work on yourbids and your budget.But you might see 40% loss due to search impression.Share that I'm sorry 40% search impression share loss due to budget.That just means your ad rank is good enough.Your quality score is good enough.You just don't have enough money in your daily budget to get all the auctions.So if you're seeing search impression share lost due to budget any percentage, then yes, the answeris you can actually push more budget in your search campaigns.Now, that doesn't mean you should, because maybe these 45 conversions for the amount that you spentis a is really poor performance, and you don't want to spend more money.Okay.So that's that's a separate conversation whether you should push more budget but whether you can pushmore budget.That's a function of search impression share lost due to budget and just a little bit more detail onhow search compression itself works.So we have the same chart 10,000 impressions, 500 clicks and 45 conversion rates.Right?So a 5% click through rate I have 10,000 impressions.How do I get to 500 clicks?Well, I get there by having a 5% click through rate.So that gives me 500 clicks because 500 is 5% of 10,000.Now say my average cost per click as Google is reporting it is $2.25.So my total campaign cost is going to be $1,125.You multiply 500 by $2.25.That gets me $1,125.Now, how did I get to 45 conversions?You get to 45 conversions because 45 is 9% of 500.That would be a 9% conversion rate.Okay.So that's when we when we think about search impression share, we look at these different metrics thatget us from impression to conversion.And what additional what movement might I be able to have with additional impressions?So again, once I have, if I have search impression share loss due to rank, that means no increasein budget.If I have a daily budget of, let's say I have a daily budget of, um, $1,200 and I increase my dailybudget to $5,000.I'm not going to get those impressions that are being lost due to rank.However, if I switch from a $1,200 budget to a 1500 $1,500 daily budget, I am going to get more impressionsof the impressions that I'm losing due to budget.Next, is there a way to limit my CPCs even with smart bidding strategies?This is a question we get all the time.It's like, yeah, I like smart bidding.I want a smart, I want to do smart bidding.I want to, you know, really make value based bidding work for me.I can't I don't really care what I pay for click.But but but I don't want to pay more than a certain amount per click.And sometimes that's anxiety.But sometimes that's actually good because as we said earlier, Google does not always get this right.So yes, the answer is you can.And this is how you do it with a portfolio bid strategy with a CPC cap.That's something which allows you to set a maximum cost per click still while using a smart biddingstrategy.So when you're going into your portfolio, you go into the Google campaign setup.You go to portfolio bid strategies.You could click GT on your keyboard, go to Portfolio Bid strategies.You could select your bidding smart bidding strategy.You would like to use target CPA for example over here.And you put in your target CPA.So maybe your target CPA is $50.I want to get I want to get conversions for $50.Right.So that could be your bidding strategy alone $50 per conversion.However you might on top of that want to control Google by saying I do not want you spending more perclick.That's when you could set your minimum and maximum bid limits.So this will ensure that no individual click will cost more than the specified amount.Providing a safeguard against excessively high bids and a pro tip filter search terms by analyzing ifCPC is greater than or less than your your limits, and check if there are higher or lower conversionrates.If conversion rates don't justify the CPC, then limit CPC.So you might be wondering when should I use this CPC limit?Well, at in general, I think when you're starting a brand new campaign, I would suggest implementinga max CPC limit if you're just getting started, if you're just getting started with target CPA, andit's not as if the business is saying like we're floating in cash, let's spend as much as we want.You could use a target CPA with a maximum bid limit, but you could get smarter with this.You go into your you go into a 30, 60, 90 day period.You look at all your search terms.You then filter your search terms that have a CPC higher than, let's say, $9.And then you look at your conversion rates and you can look at your conversion rates.You could look at your total conversions.You could look at your revenue total conversion value.You could look at your return on ad spend, total conversion value divided by cost.And you can get a sense of is it worth?Am I are the clicks that are costing me a lot, much, a lot more, which typically do indicate higherquality, right?Because higher CPCs tends to be higher quality people, higher quality opportunities, higher qualityclicks, it tends to be that way, but it's not always that way.So just do an analysis.Take a look at all.All search terms that had a higher than 8 or $9 CPC and get a sense.Am I seeing higher than average conversion rates?Still healthy return on ad spends.And if you are, then there's no reason to limit Google.But if you are seeing certain search terms wow, $25 clicks, $30 clicks, $18 clicks.There's some point of diminishing returns.There's some point where CPCs get high enough, your conversion rates and your return on ad spend
