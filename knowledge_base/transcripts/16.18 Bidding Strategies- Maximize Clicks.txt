# 16.18 Bidding Strategies- Maximize Clicks

Hi and welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to quickly go through the automated bidding strategy called Maximize Clicks.And if you remember, this is the default bidding strategy that Google ads sets when you create a newcampaign.And it's a terrible, terrible bidding strategy for almost every scenario.But let's just run through it in detail real quickly here.The objective of maximize clicks as a bidding strategy is to get as much traffic to your site as possible.If you're looking to get as much data on site behavior as possible and just get visitors in your doorwithout worrying as much about specific cost objectives, this can be helpful in some cases.So if it's the very beginning of a campaign and your boss or your client really wants a lot of data,doesn't really care about cost per click, they just want to see certain behavioral objectives.Let's say there's a really important some investor wants to know how men perform on the site differentlythan women, let's say.And you've got a really quickly get that data you don't have you don't want to err on the side of biddingtoo low and getting too few clicks, you know some some strange use cases.This could be helpful.How does it actually work?It's pretty straightforward.Google will try to get you as many clicks as possible by choosing the right bids across all the keywordsthat are using the strategist.So across all the keywords in this campaign, you can set a maximum CPC bid limit as well.So you could temper Google's autonomy by choosing a maximum CPC.But that sort of defeats the whole purpose of maximizing clicks to begin with.Spend is capped at the campaign daily budgets.Remember that what Google is doing at the keyword level and how much my clicks are going to cost arestill ultimately governed by how much I'm telling Google I'm willing to spend.So if I'm willing to spend $100 on the court over the course of a day, remember what we talked aboutwhen we talked about daily budgets that Google could spend up to $200, but Google will not exceed that,even if I'm using any, even if I'm using maximized clicks or any other autonomous bidding strategy.So just keep that in mind that your daily budget always governs anything else that's taking place beneathit.Using portfolio bid strategies allows you to apply this automation to just a set of keywords in a campaignusing a different using a different strategy.But I also want to point out that this is a setting that Google is probably going to remove, and theyhave been removing it to an extent like it used to be that I could just select five keywords in a campaignor an ad group to use maximize clicks while the other ones will use manual CPC.So don't.It's really also so so bad for organization when you want to really analyze your data.Everything should be kept separate anyway.I never recommend.One of my strongest recommendations is when you're building out your account campaigns.All campaigns should have separate bidding strategies and that's going to be how Google ads is goingto be set up to work anyway.So don't worry about that.Overall, this strategy gives Google the most control over bidding and costs of your clicks scenariowhere this might be something of use.If you think about it, say you sell acoustic guitars and you don't have data, and if you get data,then you'll be able to set good manual CBC bids.Later, you have this new instrument in the market, hollow body, jazz guitars.I play guitar myself, so it's a product category dear to my heart.It's a low volume keyword in your targeted locations and you want as much traffic as possible for thiskeyword.That's the goal.You just need data.You need to know the dynamics of the auction for this keyword and you need to know it now for whateverreason.Feedback, product improvement, website improvements, real data aggregation that's some of the benefitsof getting data.So you might apply maximize clicks to just these keywords.So you might have a campaign with just keywords for this holiday jazz guitar, rather, that would bethe better way to set it up.You would you would apply a maximized clicks bidding strategy to that campaign and you'll probably youwill definitely overspend than on what you would have had to spend, but you'll get more clicks faster.So if you're not necessarily in a budget optimization zone and you're okay with considering this someresearch and development budget, let's say R&D, then it might be something worthwhile if you wantto jump the gun and get a lot of data quickly.So there is potential use case, but of course, it certainly wouldn't be a long term play because everythingshould be controlled for the sake of profit.I'm not saying it's impossible that you might do maximize clicks in a campaign and it winds up beingvery profitable.It winds up even being more profitable than target CPA or manual CPC bidding.I'm not saying it's impossible.Google is so vast.There's so much going on behind the scenes, there's so much technology, there's so many variabilitywith human behavior, there's so much variability with with the clicks and the competition and the searchterms and the match types and the geographical settings, your ad copy, your quality score, you neverknow.And Google's always tweaking how these algorithms work.You never know.You might find a campaign that's using maximize clicks and it's killing it, and it's doing really well.And I don't feel I don't feel that I would be I would be stood corrected.I don't think that would contradict what I'm saying.I'm saying that that could happen.But that doesn't mean that it's necessary.That doesn't mean that you as a practitioner, you as someone who's responsible for optimizing thesecampaigns as best as possible, you're ultimately responsible for making the best strategic decisions.And nine times out of ten, that will not be letting Google control.How much you spend on a click.It's your money you earned.Hard for it, you should say, and you should have a much more sophisticated set up in your campaignswhere you're bidding appropriately across all your keywords.So in the next lecture, we'll talk about a semi-autonomous bidding strategy called Enhanced CPC bidding.And I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in a couple of seconds on the other side.
