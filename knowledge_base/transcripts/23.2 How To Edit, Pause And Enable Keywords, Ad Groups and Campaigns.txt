# 23.2 How To Edit, Pause And Enable Keywords, Ad Groups and Campaigns

The dimensions tab over here is going to show us data broken down by different segments that we don'thave available in other places in the account the View button is we're going to select how I want tosee my data.Or one of you would bite.You know top movers which want which keywords are generating the highest click through rates and thehighest cost.I can view my information by geographic location by the search terms and I can see a lot of differentinformation in this type mentions tab.And once again we're going to go ahead and we'll take a look at that in more detail in an account thathave more data so you can get a sense of what's going on.So that's the tab menu up over here.A few more important buttons and things whatnot before we start going into another account with somelive data.Is this some menu over here that's that's generally remained the same throughout most of the.The metrics are the key metrics like campaigns ad groups ads and keywords.You have the same sudden menu over here and that's going to be spending a lot of your time.So campaigns ad groups ads in key words those are the tabs that you're really going to be using.Most of the time to analyze and build your current audiences at extensions and mentions are going tobe used much less frequently and they're often used ad extensions are used to actually build your adextensions of course.I mentioned is audiences are only used to really view your data and set up remarketing So you're goingto want to understand the menu over here.So this is all but removed campaigns this button is specifically geared towards showing you or liveletting you choose how you want to view your data.Do you want to see all campaigns all your enabled campaigns are all your enabled and possed campaignsexcept for you removed campaigns and I'll usually look at the data it will enable campaigns right nowthat that will be nothing because we have that poost campaigns all go.All this is the same thing for ad groups where I can see all enabled and it's the same thing for adsand keywords.I can see my own able campaigns and keywords and add groups all of them but removed or all of whichwill include anything that's removed as well.So that's an important selector.Segmentation is another great tool that's used for some more advanced functions where I can segmentmy egg group data by time conversions network click type device topper's other and plus one and optician'splus one annotations is obviously if you had a Google plus share on on an ad or a keyword or aggregatethat will show you that that information segmented out.So for example if we were to if I wanted to see which groups halachah how they AGABUS performed by dayof the week I could select that segment.And down here this is exactly what it would look like.So we'll see.The ad group called rolling which talks about rolling desk chairs will be able to see how it performedon Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday and I could see all my information onmy data broken down by that segment.And same thing goes for every AG group in the account when I have that segment set up.So to remove that segment I would simply go back to segment and hit none.And now I'll go back to my normal view of the data.Filtering is a button that's going to allow us to create advanced filters just to view my data in specificways.And we'll talk about setting up a filter in a separate chapter and columns is another very importantselector which is going to allow us to choose an order.The columns that we see in this data.So here we are let's go back to campaigns.I like to get a good basic broad overview of my information at the campaign level.So I'll go to columns modify columns and here I have a screen which we've seen before which will allowme to choose the columns that I want to include.So I remove all these columns by hitting the X button on all these optional columns you see under theCamping's view under the campaign's report you have a few options.You have a few columns that you must include.So if a hit apply now all of a sudden my data became much more clean.I see my status.The campaign name.Well whether it's plausible and the status of the campaign and the budget.So if I went to columns back modify columns and go ahead and add some new columns I want to click campaigntype.We don't have we're not using labels like leave off labels.I don't need my campaign I.D. under-performance.This is some of the most important metrics I want to see clicks.I want to see impressions.I want to see click through rate.I want to see an average cost per click.I want to see my total cost.I want to see what I want to see the cost of that campaign.I want to see average position and that's probably really the most important.You know core columns then we could experiment.You can always experiment with other columns to see if you want to see that data depending on your campaigndepending on your marketing goals different metrics are going to be or how are different metrics willhave different levels of importance if we're tracking conversions and of course your campaigns shoulddefinitely always be tracking conversions.We're going to want to see.Let's see.We'll wanna see.Convert it clicks cost convert click click conversion rate if we're tracking conversion value I wantto see total conversion value and I want to see conversion value divided by cost which is my hero.And I can go to attrib. I could see you know click assisted conversions.I could see social metrics shares plus ones comments there's a lot of different cons we could add andobviously the council can get very very overwhelming.But what I would recommend is to really just keep with these core columns.For most campaigns I can choose to save this set of columns and make a name or create a name for thetelecoms that I can always add.But I'm going to do the Nam's can to hit apply.I have to de-select say and now I have the Komfort I want to see I have my Clix impressions campaigntype search network only click through rate average cost per click cost average position.So and so forth.And these are the cons I saw so the column isn't the rich you're going to use quite often to modifyand to edit and to change how you're viewing this data.So I could also change my column by agates I might want to see different you know information at thekeyword level I might want to see different types of columns and different apps data so I would usethat comes button to go in there and to really take a set take a look at what's going on going backto campaigns.There's a couple of more buttons over here that are important to know.One is the graph icons show and hide the graph.So I can click show and hide this graph over here.And that's an issue that's going to allow me to get a clear sense of exactly what is going on from aline chart perspective so I can choose clicks verse.You know conversions if I wanted to I could kind of manipulate that graph.And once again obviously we're not showing any information but once our account starts getting datais show hide grab icon is a great way to get an overall sense and we could hover over each specificday if we have it that's a daily we might have a set to weekly monthly and see how the data has changedbased on our K.P. eyes that we select here and we don't have to have it to be versus we can just donone.And we'll just show clicks this button over here which we've seen before already is the downlow reportand it pulls up our our options for downloading the current view that we're seeing here and the searchbox will allow us to do a quick filter.So if I want to find if I have a whole bunch of campaigns or let's go to keywords and I want to usemy search I want to find all keywords with the word modern.So I just type in modern hit enter and it creates an automatic filter with a keyword text containingmonor.I could expand that filter and add new rules.So I wanted to contain the word modern and it kind of you know I could say has a quality score of atleast greater or equal to a five and apply and that will you know change my results based on my newfilter I could also just clear the filter out and start from scratch.So that's the search box down here we have the like we just saw the tape guys that we could do versus.So kids first impressions are clicks for us you know certain impressions share will go talk about alittle bit more detail of what those columns are and over here we have the data selector or the rangeselector for this graph down here up here in the upper right hand corner a very important drop downselector but it's simply your date range so that Google gives you a whole bunch of different pre-selecteddate ranges.And you also have the option to choose a custom date range and we click on custom.We go ahead and change the dates for which we'd like to view our data and then click apply.Another cool feature of the date range selector is allows us to compare.So I wanted to compare my information from the previous period or same period last year.I can go ahead and do that and click apply.And now I'll be able to open up these columns and it'll show me the difference in the data between thosedate ranges and it will show me how much the the data has changed whether it's increased decreased andthe percentage that it's either increased or decreased.That's a very very cool function to compare how you're doing so you can compare last week to the weekbefore last month to the month before.This past week to the same week last year or to compare to completely custom date range with the comparefunction is really cool.If you'd like to set the compare function off all you do is hit this button under the date range Lechterand hit apply.And now you're back to your normal specific date range view down below here we have some more buttons.These are pretty self-explanatory.They exist for campaigns ad groups ads and as well.Editing is all the different changes that you can make to the information you have selected.So this edit menu is going to change whether you're in your ad groups ads keywords or campaigns tabappear but it's all the possible edits that you could make.So if I selected you know these two key words here and a hit edit I couldn't do any of these thingsto those two selected keywords I can copy them.I could paste keywords that I've copied it that I've copied.I could download a spreadsheet.I could change the text or the key words I could change the magtapes I could do a whole bunch differentthings in this edit menu and we'll talk about where and go ahead and actually make some of these changesin a later video but this is just to show you what it looks like.Details will be different based on the overall tab that you're in.So for this under our keyboards tab we could go ahead and see search terms select all the search termsis what we call the search query report.And we're going to take a look at that in a separate video kind of dedicated for the search query.So so hold on there.Got a secured diagnosis for those key words that we have selected and we take a look at auction sitesauction insites is a really cool feature that's going to show us our competitive landscape which othercompanies are we overlapping with in the auction how often and what our average position is so that'ssomething which is going to be cool and we'll take a look at the live account to see what that lookslike.Big strategy will show us the will give us the ability to change how we build whether we want to usea flexible strategy for what to use manual CPC bidding which of course we generally do.So we'll we'll be able to set up MANUELL CBC bidding when once we're ready to create our own bids atAkure level and the automake button is something which we're going to use very very infrequently.We're going to cover it in a later video but it's the tool that will allow us to create some automatedrules so for example one rule might be decrease the max CPC bid of any keyword with the quality scorebelow 5.So if we wanted that rule to run every single morning to analyze our account look for key words witha 5 quad core and decrease our bid or pause the keyword we could set that up over here via automatedrules.And we'll talk about setting up automated rules in another chapter.So that was a basic overview of the of the dashboard of the different buttons.Once again appear as you know we have our gear icon as we navigate to billing account settings linkedaccounts and your help your little bell icons your notifications.You'll see when you have new opportunities and if you have some conflicts if you have any issues withbilling you'll get some notifications appear which you could dismiss.And over here is your account which will allow you to sign out add an account and navigate to otheraccount settings.That's the overall view of the dashboard.I know that this is a tremendous amount of information.It's extremely complex.There's a lot of different buttons and tabs.But I wanted to give you a basic sense of what all the buttons do.Even if we're not going to be using all of them just so you shouldn't feel that you're left in the darkwith anything.So that's really how the the basic overall account looks like those are how the buttons work.You don't need to remember or make sure that you could you know find anything you need right away.The more you just work in your account the more you're adding keywords the more you're analyzing yourkeywords the more Camping's you added at groups you add the easier it's going to be for you to navigateto the areas that you need.You're going to be able to pick these things up you're going to start picking these things up as ifthey were second nature.You're going to know how to add extensions you're going to know how to analyze and do segmentation.And look at your conversion history and change your columns and view your graph and download your reportsand your negative keyword lists.There's a lot to know but it's going to come just out of habit.So just keep at it keep working in the account keep building new keywords and all this stuff is goingto come.You're going to get it it's going to work it's going to click.We're going to continue to cover a lot of these features of the dashboard.A lot of analyzing of the accounts looking we're going to take a look at a whole bunch of new live accountsand you're going start getting a very very clear sense of how all of this work.So just just you kind of keep at it.Get a basic sense of what the different buttons do.But the main thing is just spend that time.So that's what that's it for this video.That's the overview of the campaign dashboard in the next video we're talking about you know reallybuilding this campaign out adding campaigns had an ad campaign ad and ad groups had agcy words had tochange our key word math types things like that.And it's going to be a good way for us to start building out and expanding on our foundation that we'vebuilt so far.So that's it for now.Thank you very much for watching this one and we will see you again very soon.In the very next video.Thanks guys.Talk to you later
