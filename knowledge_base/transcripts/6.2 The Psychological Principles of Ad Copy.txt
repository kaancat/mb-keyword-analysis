# 6.2 The Psychological Principles of Ad Copy

Okay.Let's talk about the behavioral model pioneered by BJ Fogg.And this is behavior equals motivation times ability times trigger all according to BJ Fogg a very popularmodel.Behavior only happens, um, when there's motivation for the behavior.There's the ability to perform the behavior, and there's a trigger for the behavior.So here's the curve you have on the right side of the curve.You have action.The triggers succeed on the and the gray shaded area.You have inaction.This is where triggers fail.And on the x axis you have ability.On the y axis you have motivation.So when you have low ability and low motivation, you're going to fail.If you have high ability but medium mediocre motivation, you might pass.If you have high ability and high motivation, the action is going to seed.The trigger for the action is going to succeed.And there's a, you know, a very simple example.Say I'm sitting on I'm sitting in my on my couch and the doorbells and I get up.Okay, well, that was a behavior.So there was motivation.I want to see who's at the door.There was a there was ability.I was able to stand up and there was a trigger, the bell ringing.And if you look at any behavior, the fact that I'm sitting here by my desk at 7:00 at night recording,I have motivation to record this.I have the ability, I have the equipment, I have the time.I have the resources, I have the knowledge.Um, and I have a trigger.The trigger was, hey, we need to update our content.Okay, so there was a trigger.There's a motivation ability, and you could just think about any action or behavior you take, andyou break it down into having the motivation to do it, having the ability to do it and something thattriggered that behavior.The trigger could be a thought.The trigger could be an event.It could be a sound, it could be a person, it could be a conversation, so on and so forth.Um, so when we think about selling and messaging, it's important to Understand where the tension mightbe.So let me show you an example.Say you're a personal injury lawyer.Okay.Or you're advertising for a personal injury lawyer.The motivation's very high, right?Somebody got hit by a car, is injured and feels that they might be able to get a $2 million settlement.I would say in that case, the motivation is extremely high.So on this y axis, they're up here.So why would the behavior.Why would they not convert and submit the form.Well I would say the perceived ability is very low with a personal injury lawyer I might be really motivated,but I might be like, look, oh, there's going to be so much paperwork.I don't know how to deal with lawyers.I might not even be eligible for the claim.Too much time might have passed this big brand or, you know, it was a Tesla that that crashed intome.And they have so much they have their lawyers are much better.Or I slipped and I fell at a McDonald's and I'm like, there's no way a lawsuit is going to be successful.So my perceived ability to get the behavior I want, which is a successful settlement, might be verylow.So when you're writing ad copy and messaging, your job is not to say it's it's going to be so greatto get money.It's going to be so great to settle.It's going to be so great to, to, to to get this windfall.They know that already.They have the motivation.The motivation is there.You don't need to work on their motivation.You need to work on their perceived ability.So your messaging should be it's simple.Nine out of ten clients get some money.We're going to hold your hand and walk you through the exact process.Just submit the form in.One of our specialists is going to handle the entire case for you.And believe it or not, more people than you might think actually get money.And they get that money really fast.Okay, that's the idea, right?So you want to your messaging has to encourage and change the perception of ability.Um, on the other hand, on the other hand, let's go back to my example, where I impulsively boughtthis $20 folding origami laptop stand couch contraption.So, okay, I'm scrolling through Instagram and and I see this, like $30 thing and it's an e-commerce,so I have no like my perceived ability is very high.My perceived ability is very high.But like I all I need to do is click.I know I have the money, I can afford the $30.Um, I know how to use an e-commerce website.I know how to click on and do a swipe up on Instagram.I know how to autofill my contact information super super easy.It's my motivation that's low.It's like, I'm not like, I don't really need a stupid laptop stand.I have enough crap in my house.Um.I'm fine.I could put my laptop on my lap or on a pillow or at my desk.It's like I just have low motivation.The trigger was the ad, right?There was a trigger.Here's a message.Here's a video in front of my face.There's a behavior that may or may not happen.The behavior may or may not.The behavior is purchasing this -- thing.It may or may not happen, but what the ad did was a very good job at increasing my motivation.It made the thing look so cool that it could flip and fold in different ways.It was super, super thin.It looked like it was made from very high quality materials.It showed how this thing could be used laying down, but sitting up with your feet up, it could beslipped into your backpack.The messaging did not talk about the ability.It didn't say one thing about we we we we do e-commerce.It's so easy to check out today.All you need to do is in six clicks.You could you could purchase this thing.That would have been a big mistake because they don't need to focus on my perceived ability.They have to focus on my motivation to buy this thing.And they did a good job, and I impulsively bought that thing.Um, so anyway, in the next lesson, we're going to talk about my five tips for writing ad copy.If you follow these five tips, you will write successful copies.Successful ad copy, I promise.We'll see you in a moment.
