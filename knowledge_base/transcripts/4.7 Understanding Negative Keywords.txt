# 4.7 Understanding Negative Keywords

Welcome back.Let's talk about negative keywords and and understanding the philosophy and the framework.So three three basic tent poles here one harmful terms terms that we don't want triggering our ads.Uh beneficial terms, terms that we do want triggering our ads and subjective terms.Terms that we're not sure if we want triggering our ads.Of course, negative keywords most obviously are used for harmful terms, terms that we know might beused in relationship with products or services that we sell, but we absolutely do not want to showan ad for that search term.For example, if you're an e-commerce business that doesn't sell on Amazon, maybe Amazon is a negativekeyword.If you're an e-commerce business that doesn't sell things for free or offer things for free, or youdon't want to show your ads for any search, queries that include the word free.So you need to understand here machine learning and how machine learning helps and machine learning'srelationship with negative keywords.Google uses over 100,000 signals to optimize bids and targeting.So for example, they're going to use previous browsing data.They're going to use other accounts targeting and performance.They're going to use GPS data and credit card information and in-market segments.And Google knows quite a bit about you.Time of day.How you respond to certain types of ads.There's over 100,000 individual data points that Google is going to use to optimize how much to bid,whether or not to bid at all, and what audiences to go after.Search queries are just one of those signals that influence the bidding process.So when you go and you sculpt with negative keywords and you add negative keyword lists, you're givingGoogle one of the many signals that Google is going to look at to determine whether or not to bid,how much to bid, and what the predicted conversion rate for that bid is going to be.From a best practices optimization perspective.Search query data, mine.That's that weekly routine, or at least weekly regularly review search term performance using n grams.Again, we have a full walkthrough in the Adventure Academy library.How to run an n gram n-gram analysis.But it's important because when you export that search term report and you run the n-gram analysis,you're going to see an aggregate which search terms, words and phrases you should be adding as a count,as a count level negatives.Those are those harmful search queries.Harmful search queries almost always are best added at the account level.That way when you create a new campaign, you could easily just apply that negative keyword list withouthaving to redo it and mistakenly launching a campaign without that harmful negative keyword list alreadyapplied subjective terms.Maybe the word free is subjective, right?So take Adventure Media as an example.We technically offer a free audit, right?In our sales process.We're getting on the phone with the prospect, um, we're giving them some ideas.We're getting to know them a little bit.So if somebody's searching for a free audit, I might want to bid on them.It's subjective.I'm not sure because we're not a free.We're a we are a fee for service business.We charge for our work.Um, so maybe somebody who's searching for the something for free might not be a prospect or or a personI'd like to bid on, but I'm not sure.So it's subjective.So what I would do is I would investigate, I would see how much are we actually spending on searchqueries that contain the word free?What is our conversion rate for those searches?What are the behavioral engagement metrics on site for those searches.So that's the search query data.Mine.Second is monitoring.You want to just keep an eye on the search term report and be willing to make adjustments to your negativekeyword lists based on the campaigns maturity and performance.If I'm not getting enough traffic, I'm not getting enough volume, and I'm not spending my daily budget,maybe my negative keyword list became too aggressive.So I'm going to begin removing some of those subjective negative keywords from my list.I'm going to be opening up my my match types from phrase to broad, or from exact match to phrase.And finally, I'll use data trends to make informed decisions on keyword exclusion.So if I go to Google Search Console and I see certain search terms in.And this is very relevant for political seasons.It's relevant for certain movies that might come out, or for certain celebrities or for certain historicalevents, certain holidays.There are certain phrases and words that begin getting used very frequently in certain times of theyear.And you want to be monitoring those trends, and those trends will appear in your own search terms report.You could also use Google Trends as a great outside external tool research tool to monitor how aggressiveor conservative your negative keyword lists should be over time.When you're thinking about misspellings, you don't have to add every variant of a negative keyword,so just add the correct spelling in your negative keyword and it will block all misspellings.So for example, if you want to block the search term or the word YouTube from triggering any of yourkeywords to show an ad, just add YouTube correctly spelled and Google will not show your ad for a misspellingof the word YouTube, so you don't have to go and waste a ton of time looking at every possible misspellingand adding them as negative keywords.Just add the negative keyword once spelled correctly.Negative keyword lists are found under the Exclusion lists tab in your shared library.So you go to the shared library.You go to exclusion lists inside your Google Ads UI and you have negative keyword lists.You could then add your first negative keyword list.You would give it a name, and then you would add all the negative keywords you don't use to.You don't need to use the negative dash sign when you're creating a negative keyword list.By default, in the negative keyword list tool, all of the keywords you enter will be added and considernegative keywords.Once you create your list, you could apply that list to any of the campaigns inside your account.You don't have to apply it to all campaigns.You might have a negative keyword list that you'd like to apply to all of your key campaigns, but youmight have some test campaign that's running a very broad match strategy or a match strategy at a verylow budget, and you want to leave it alone, and you don't want to give it a throttling with negativekeywords.That's a perfectly reasonable and I would say quite intelligent approach.You don't have to use negative keyword lists.You can also go and add individual or a group of negative keywords at the ad group or campaign levelitself.And here's a pro tip when you're auditing an account, if you're looking at an account from scratchor you're you're you're pitching the management of an account, analyze negative keywords at the adgroup or campaign level to make sure the account isn't filtering out keywords you would want to includesometimes.And I've seen this well, I've seen this hundreds of times.An account that's been around for a while might have had a bunch of negative keywords that the ad groupor campaign level, but then some manager or somehow the account started using account level lists thatwere applied to campaigns.But but still, the ad group level has a bunch of negative keywords that really shouldn't be negativekeywords anymore because and they're throttling volume too much.So when you're auditing an account, it's always good to check the actual negative keywords at the adgroup and the campaign level.On top of auditing the negative keyword lists inside that account.Um, in the next lesson, we're going to do an example walkthrough to get a sort of sort of a more handson keyboard feel of how all of this comes together.And I look forward to seeing you there.
