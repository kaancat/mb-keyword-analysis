# 20.18 Using Additional Research Tools to Get Negative Keyword Ideas

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, I want to show you a couple of additional tools that you could use to help you findgood negative keyword ideas.And these are negative keywords that are not those keywords that are generating search terms that couldbe or should be profitable but just aren't working out.And you have to sort of make the decision, do I knock it out completely or do I go try to work on qualityscore?Do I try to lower the bids?Do I try to change the bid strategy?Do I try to rewrite my ads to qualify?Do I try to change my landing page?There's a whole host of things you could do for those types of search terms and keywords that aren'tyet profitable, but could be.There's also a lot of terms that are just not going to be profitable, and it would be a pure wasteof money for you to be bidding on those keywords and potentially getting clicks on those keywords,racking up a bill of irrelevant traffic that is not going to convert.So I want to show you a couple quick tools to help you get some excellent ideas, because it's hardto sort of predict all the bad keywords, all the bad search terms and keywords you're going to get.So here we are back in Google and we want to start off with a search that's relevant to the campaignproducts that we want to potentially find negative keyword ideas for.So if we go back to our account real quick, we're looking at office chairs.That's the campaign that we're working on now.And I'm going to go back to Google and I'm just going to start typing in office chairs and I'm not goingto hit enter.I'm going to see what happens.So I'm going take office chairs and we see this dropdown of what Google calls their autocomplete suggestionsright over here.All right.So these are suggestions that Google thinks are popular and we could potentially get some really goodnegative keyword ideas here.We need to start thinking about what we sell.So what does the search near me?Right over here?What what does that signify?What does Wal Mart signify?Amazon Staples, Cheap Costco, Target, Office Depot.There's two things here.One, these are popular search terms.So we know that any of these searches are likely to be high volume.And if they're not relevant to us and we have broad match keywords like office chairs or we have phrasematch keywords like office chairs, a keyword like this could and most likely will start getting a lotof traffic for all these different types of search terms.And we want to make sure that our account is really well optimized before we let any spend run awayfrom us.So.Taking our case of poppin well near me tells me that a person is looking for office chairs local.They're not looking to buy online.So right away that's a really good idea to add a negative keyword.So I can go back to Google, open up a campaign, go to my negative keywords, go to my keywords tabwhere I'm going to find my negative keywords tab.I'm going to open up, click new negative keyword, and I'm going to start looking at this autocompletesuggestion list and adding things as we go along.So near me, we're not a local store, so we want to add that as negative keyword.Let's go back and see what's going on.We have Walmart, Amazon, Staples.These are all good ideas for negatives because these are people who are specifically looking for officechairs at us at a specific store, Amazon Staples.Cheap.Let's say poppin is on the higher level and people who are looking for cheap office chairs are lookingfor much well below our starting price.Cheap.Costco.Target.Office Depot.She?Target.Costco.Office Depot now.Some of these search terms are not absolute negatives.Right.Take Amazon, for example.Amazon probably sells a lot of office chairs that are similar to ours.The customer is looking for Amazon because they probably have a a desire to buy from Amazon.But that doesn't mean that they can't be swayed to buy from pop and or from your website if your productand your service and your price really meets the requirements for what they're looking for.So a lot of these competitor terms and a lot of these terms that are persons looking for specific place,I would recommend using them as negatives to begin.And then as your budget increases, as your campaigns are getting dialed in, you could slowly add themback in and I'll show you how to remove negative keywords.So I'm going to click Choose the Campaign.I want to add it to, which is my office chairs campaign and click Save.And now say for example, some time goes by, our campaigns are profitable and we say, hey, we'vebeen knocking out Amazon with this broad match negative.And we know that office chairs Amazon is a high volume search because Google offered it as an auto suggestion.When I started typing in office chairs, maybe we could be profitable on that search term.Maybe enough people who are searching for four offer shares on Amazon would be willing to click ourads to what we have to offer and potentially buy from us.So I can go into my Amazon negative keyword.I could easily find that by doing a command or control.If Amazon select it, go to edit and remove.And now that's off the campaign level.Negative keyword and search terms with Amazon will now be eligible to trigger keywords.Going back to Google, say we click office chairs for sale.And as you continue to build out a long tail, we start seeing additional potential negatives.So here's used.I see ol x is probably the name of a brand craigslist and I think we added use in Craigslist already.So try to do different searches on Google to see how the autocomplete suggestions might change overtime.So if I do desk chairs, I might see some new ideas.So IKEA for teens without wheels, right?So we're seeing some additional ideas without wheels is a good search for us because we do sell deskchairs without wheels.But IKEA IKEA is one that I would probably want to add and for teens is another one that I want to add.So I want to go and add IKEA and I'm going to add teens because we don't sell that type of office furniture.We sell corporate office furniture and IKEA is below a price point that we sell as well.And I click office chairs as a campaign and save that again to my negative keyword lesson.And you're seeing now as we're finding these autocomplete suggestions, we're getting some really goodideas for negative keywords.We could jump back into Google and ask you another thing.So let's say we look at we do office chairs and we actually do a search.We hit enter, we do a Google search and see what comes up.So we see some Google shopping ads, we see some text ads, so on and so forth.And I want to scroll down to the bottom of the page where I see these searches related to office chairssection over here.And again, we're going to start getting some potential ideas for negative keywords that Mike mightthat might work well for us.So a lot of them will will be similar like we know we see cheap over here is similar.We have Walmart we have Amazon ergonomic.Now ergonomic is a is a is a type of chair that we do offer.So ergonomic would not we would not want to end that as negative Costco we have Staples Executive Officechairs is another good one for sales another good one.We would not we would not want to end those as a negative so I could go ahead and click any one of these.Let's say let's say I see office chairs.Cheap is a bad one.So what I would do is I would click it and I would scroll back down again to the bottom of the pageand see if those suggested searches have changed and might give me some additional good ideas.So I see Target.Cute desk chairs.Cute desk chairs is something that we that I think does fit in with with what we sell, desk chairs,IKEA.We have desk chairs, target office chairs, staples.We have as a negative desk, as a negative account, as a negative keyword already.So in this case, these searches related to office chairs, the related searches on Google are not reallygiving us any additional mind blowing negative keyword opportunities.But you'll see as time goes on, in many cases you will find some additional tools and you will findsome initial negative keywords over there.I want to show you one more tool in this lecture that's really, really helpful.And we're going to come back to this tool when we talk about doing keyword research for positive keywordsas well.But head over to a website called Souvlaki.So Vele.And this is a really neat tool that shows you the top most popular searches on all these different searchengines, starting with Google, Amazon, Yahoo, eBay, Bing answers, e-comm, Wikipedia, YouTube,etc..And let's just do the same thing that we started off with looking for office chairs.Now if we look up here.Now, if we look up here in the Google section, we're seeing a whole bunch of search terms that arepopular on Google that we've already added.So we have near me, we have Walmart, Amazon, we have Staples, we have all these.But let's take a look at see if we could see any other ideas from other search engines.So here on the YouTube one, we have gaming OC.That's a good one to add as negative.And we've already done that because we did that through the search firms reports, so we don't needto add it again.2018 officers were bigger guys.Interesting office chairs review.Ooh, that's a good one.How about office chairs, jackass?That's a good one.Jackass is a is a show.And they probably had some sort of or a movie.They probably had some sort of stunt with an office chair.So I see two over here that I could probably review.I could probably add as a negative.Let's see if we see anything on Bing heavy people.That's something we do.Cell officers USA near me, officers with lumbar support, officers for bad backs.These are all great.And again, as you're you're probably seeing that we could find some interesting ideas for positivekeywords using suitable of course and that's why we're going to come back to this shortly.Funky office, comfortable office chairs, fabric.Steelcase All right.So here's Steelcase is a competitor term.We're going to add that as a negative because we don't sell in.Steelcase chairs I know are much more expensive.So just over here, just real quick with very, very easy research tools that are completely free,we found three new additional negative keywords Steelcase Review and Jackass.I'm going to go back into Google and add those as negative keywords.It's like my campaign.Steelcase review and Jackass.And as you're getting a sense just by doing this preliminarily, we're already starting to save a lotof money on wasted clicks and go back to survival.And I can change my search.Let's say let's say just for example, I'm doing a a campaign for file cabinet so I can start off withfile cabinets.And I can take a look at what's going on and a lot of these other and I can begin taking a look at whatare some of the most popular searches on all these different platforms.So I could see that file cabinets.Wood is a very popular search on Google.That's not something we sell.So I would add that as a negative keyword for that account, I could see maybe, maybe, maybe we don'tsell to draw file cabinets, maybe we only sell three door file cabinets.I see that that's a popular search.And a lot of these you wouldn't like just to reiterate, you wouldn't have these ideas on your own.So you Google go through each one, go through Google first, then YouTube second.If your e-commerce go through Amazon second, definitely go through Bing, Yahoo, eBay and Cars.com,Overstock.com, you'll find some additional ideas.This is just an aggregator of the popular, most popular searches for each one of these for whateveryou enter into this little search box over here in the middle.And it's a really, really neat tool.And we use it all the time and it's a treasure trove of negative keyword and positive keyword ideasthat you might not have ordinarily thought of.You take those keyword ideas, you bring them in to your account and you start building out those negativekeyword lists.At the campaign level, the aggregate level, it's super important, it's super profitable.And it's this is like I'm telling you, the reason why I'm focusing so much time on this is becausethis optimization, doing it consistently, every day, every couple of days that your account accruesmore data, more clicks, more, more, more search terms is another opportunity to go into that searchterms, report and find new negative opportunities.In the next lecture, I'm going to talk to you a little bit about add group level negative keyword strategies,which really primarily focus on what we call traffic sculpting, which we briefly mentioned.But I'm going to give you a few more additional use cases when traffic is sculpting has been profitablefor us at our agency and you could figure out ways to apply traffic sculpting into your own account.I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of seconds in the next lecture two years from now.
