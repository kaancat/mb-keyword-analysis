# 16.23 Understanding Sitelink Extensions

How do Google ads fans in welcome back and the next bunch of lectures we're going to talk about ad extensions.Your core ad is a headline and you have some description and you have a display URL, but then you havethe opportunity to really enhance your ads with all different sorts of ad extensions.And that's what we're going to be talking about.Here are the different types of extensions, how to set them up with some strategies, how to use themto your benefit in the most effective way.So going down here in back into our computer, into campaign settings, we see that we have site linkextensions called extend call out extensions and call extensions.Those are the three primary forms of extensions of extensions.But if we select and twirl down additional settings, we see structured snippet extensions, app extensions,message extensions, location promotion price extensions as well.And they all sort of do different things and could enhance your ad.But first, let's jump into our slides and we're going to talk about site link extensions and we'llgo a little bit more into the benefits of using ad extensions in the first place.So so let's talk briefly about the three primary benefits of using ad extensions.First and foremost, more SERP real estate, which means you get more space on the search engine resultspage.Your ad is actually bigger.Advertisers are competing with a lot of other options on the search engine results page.You have organic results, you have information boxes, you have shopping ads, you have competitortext ads.And the more space you get, the higher your click the rate will be because the more visually impactfulyour ad is going to be just straight up.It's more space.You could also offer the user more options.This is a big thing.Site links with descriptions, phone numbers, location.Also more product information.By giving people more options, you're letting people know more about your company, your products orservices because sites like extensions through site like extensions and also phone call extensions andquality extensions, it tells people more information and through certain sorts, through certain typesof ad extensions, like site link extensions and call extensions, you give people other modes of contactingyou, right.You could allow actually there's actually text message basics extensions that are a beta which are goingto be are rolling out.There's phone number extensions.People could call you directly, whether it be through a desktop or a mobile phone.And if you have site link extensions, you could tell you could have people go directly to specificpages.The other third benefit of add extensions is the increase in quality score.Google releases that exact formula, but we do know that we do know that site link extensions or ratherad extensions in general does go into quality score.Overall, we know quality score is made up of click through rate relevancy and landing page experience.It also takes your use of ad extensions into account click.The rate also gets increased, which will help increase quality score because you're using you're givingthe user more options and you're also taking a more space.And just by virtue of that, you're going to have an increase in, in, in click through rate.Here's a quick image.These are some slick extensions on the very first result.You see that there is a map's extension with a location.There are four site extensions, shot mattresses, living rooms, living rooms, on sale shop, livingroom shop, dining rooms.Those are all site link extensions.There's also reviews extensions.There's all sorts of things going on here.So let's just briefly talk about site extensions because they're the most commonly used by far the mostcommonly used form of ad extension.They really should be used in every single account no matter what.And they increase the size of the ad the most.So it gives you the most additional real estate on the page.Slightly extensions are clickable, links with headlines and descriptions.So it's almost like writing a mini ad and you could add eight, ten, 12 sentence extensions, althoughat most four will show up at any time, so you'll have the option to show at most four.Sometimes Google will show only two.Sometimes Google will show with the headline or without the headline.I mean, I'm sorry.So sometimes Google will show it with the headline and not the description.Sometimes Google will show your site extension with the headline and the description.You have no control over that.That's something that is totally up to Google, but you could also send the user to additional innerpages.That may better answer that question by using separate landing page URLs for every single site linkextension.And that's a really huge thing.So people typical cyclic extensions that are good ideas to use as templates as a contact us page, anFAQ page or frequently asked question page.If your E commerce, you might want to send people to your clearance page because if a person reallywants to shop clearance, they might want to go directly to that page or some other page that mightbe relevant to your specific to your specific campaign.Remember, every campaign might be different.So campaigns might have different styling extensions.You also might want to have site link extensions that are applied to all campaigns based on an accountlevel site like extensions.And I'll show you how to set those up.It's pretty cool.In a future chapter, I'm going to teach you how to use a script.To keep all the extensions across all your ad groups the same.So if you edit them in one place, it's a big pain in the neck to have to go and edit the sentence extensionsin every single ad group, in every campaign throughout an entire account.So there's a really, really cool script.I'm going to teach you how to use it, which automatically updates all your styling extensions.Looking at just one campaign, it's really, really neat.Site link extensions also give you the best chance of increasing click through rate of your ad againbecause you're just giving four more places a person could click a couple of policies here.No link text repetition so you can have the same site link extension four times, duplicate URLs orthird party URLs and setting extensions.So the root URL of the of the of the landing page URLs of your site link extensions have to go to thesame Web page URL of the main headline of your ad.That's the thing which is really important to keep in mind.You can send them to a different website.It has to be it can be a different page, an inner page, but it can't be a different website.The same root URL needs to be remained remain consistent across all site link extensions.And lastly, here's our picture again, same picture as before and just a pro tip.You could use Google Analytics or other analytics software to get great ideas.Take a look at what other pages people are going to.So if people are landing so let's just take a look at the board.And this is something which is worth spending just a second on because it's actually a really usefultool to get better extensions and get a better click rate and also a better conversion rate.Because if you send people to the pages that are most useful for them, you're going to have a much,much higher chance of seeing success with the money you're spending on that ad.Right.It just sort of all make sense in that way.So using analytics now, you might know that my Contact US page is a really popular page.On my fake page is a really popular page, but say you're a bigger website, a bigger ecommerce site,and this is something that you might have the opportunity managing for clients.So you could look at analytics and using analytics, you could see what are the 1 to 5 most popularpages on my site.Right.And I might and analytics will show me that because I can look at analytics and I could say show methe most, the sort, the URLs that have the most visits.So that's one way to get ideas for site extensions.You can even get more advanced.You could look at behavioral flows.And Google Analytics, and we'll look at that later on in this course when we show you some things aboutGoogle Analytics, although this is not an analytics course and you could say people who come to thispage, so let's say in pop and I'm sending people to my office chair page.Right.What are the most common pages that a person goes to next from there?So and if you think about it through the eyes of a larger website, some of the some of these thingsmight not be so obvious.So say I see that people the most common second page is a is the, let's say, pillows.We sell, let's say we sell pillows.And then the second most common page are rugs.And then desks.So if I see that people who come to this page on my website most likely go to other pages on my website,then I could get those ideas and I could use these as extensions for my campaigns or for extensionsfor ads in the office chair campaign.And I could do that at the campaign level if I have another campaign for pens.Right.I could I could look at Google Analytics and I could see one of the most popular pages, and maybe I'llalways have an FAQ page as a site link extension or a contact page as a site extension because you dowant to be able to answer basic questions people might have.That's what I recommend.So use analytics to get those ideas.I think it's really, really worthwhile.Site link extensions could show up both on mobile and desktop.Here's what those look like.Here's a for extensions for Geico and for the search LSAT tutors near me.Here's again for something extensions that do show up on mobile devices.So slightly extensions very, very, very worthwhile doing it.And I also recommend using a minimum adding a minimum of eight seven extensions if you can.Four.You could get away with.You could also load two.But if you have eight, then Google will rotate them and you'll see you'll be able to see which onesare performing the best.Let's go back to our campaign and configure some extensions together.So I'm going to twirl that down and I'm going to select create new side extension.And I have 25 characters of text, which is like a headline description description to a final URL andGoogle didn't show me a preview.So say we're not going to go into analytics now.I don't even have access to pop and analytics.Of course I'm going to go into office chairs, stools and let's say I might want to find is there anFAQ page somewhere, a warranty?That's a good one for E commerce.And we're going to take a warranty.And I'm going to take the headline here and I'm going to go back into Google.And I'm going to type in my headline warranty for pop and bread and furniture too long.So how about see our warranty?And I have the final rail saved to my clipboard.Paste that in and I'm going to find a what?I'm getting a warning here.It's not a secure page, apparently for some reason, but let's just say https because you have to bean https now.And Google, that's another thing that we'll talk about in compliance and I'll say something like.Check out our warranty details.We stand behind every purchase.All right.So that would be and then I could also have site you are options and we'll talk about what these wouldmean when we talk about tracking template.But basically if I want to pass certain information for the sake of analytics, if it's coming froma campaign from LinkedIn or whatever it may be, dynamic called value, track parameters and Googleads, if you're interested in knowing what those are right now, then you can just look up value trackparameters.But we will talk about that at a certain point in time.We don't need to add any site linked URL options.You typically don't advance options.I could say my device preference is mobile, which doesn't mean that that these that this site linkextension will never show up on desktop, but Google will it'll way towards more impressions on mobiledevices.I could also schedule, start and end dates for a specific site like extension.This is actually quite useful if you're running a specific promotion, a specific sale.If you're doing a three day 80% off my clearance items, I could just make I could create somethingextensions that go to that clearance page and have a start date and an end date.And I could also schedule a specific site like extensions.That's really cool.So if I want to run my site extension to promote a specific service, if I'm a local company and I offerservices, if I'm a cleaning company and I want to have a signing extension to promote 25% off carpetcleaning, but only want to promote it during certain hours of the morning.Let's say we're my bookings are typically slow.Then I have a site like extension that only runs, I might say all days or Monday's through Fridays.You know, it's starting at 6:30 a.m. to.1:45 p.m. where I know historically my my call volume is really low, so I want to offer this promotion,but only, I only want to offer this promotion during those times.So this specific site link will only run during those times.Now I know it seems it's quite a bit of work to set up every individual site link.On Click Save and then it's automatically added.So I have a list of site links here and in the right hand column, it's selected to be used for thiscampaign.I could select it and I could select it over here and use it in the campaign.These extensions are going to be saved.They are reusable.So the next time you go to create a campaign, whatever static extensions you create, now you can justchoose from a list that's sort of a beautiful part of cycling extensions that they're reusable.And once you create them, once you you do have to spend time and put in the work to create them originally.But once you create those extensions, they are reusable throughout the other campaigns and groups,so on and so forth.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about call out extensions, what they can do and the benefitthey could have.But I really think that you should focus and spend some time.One of the early training training processes that we go through here is whenever a new account managerstarts creating new campaigns.One of the things we check for is every single campaign has to have at least 4 to 8 extensions attachedto it and even ideally.Different ad groups in different campaigns, depending on how you structured your account, should havedifferent styling extensions as well for the sake of giving the user very specific information that'svery useful to them.So you could increase the effectiveness and increase your quality score, increase your click throughrate.So that's that that's all about extensions.It's pretty fun.That's exciting stuff.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about call it extensions and then we'll breeze through therest of these extensions and basically wrap up the core group of campaign settings.I look forward to seeing you guys very soon in the next lecture.
