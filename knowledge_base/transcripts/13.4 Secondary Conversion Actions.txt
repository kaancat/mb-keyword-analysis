# 13.4 Secondary Conversion Actions

Welcome back.Let's talk through conversion tracking technique number three which would be secondary conversion actions.So we talked through primary conversion actions which are a direct reflection of real business objectivesand revenue generated.Secondary conversion actions indirectly contribute to your business objectives and help move users alongthe funnel.So we talked about um, with a e commerce account, your purchase conversion action would be your primaryobjective.And maybe a secondary conversion action would be add to cart or check out initiated or viewed a productpage.Um, for lead gen, it might be um, your, you know, you won the deal.The people you won the deal.Their closed deal indirectly contribute.Might be your form fills might be your mql SQL.It depends on how you want to set up your account depending on the data you have.Um, but those are indirect secondary conversion actions.Some people might call them micro conversion actions also.So secondary or micro.Um, you only want to use secondary conversion actions as your main goal if your campaign focuses onactions other than direct sales.So maybe you're trying to get, um, email newsletter signups.Maybe that's your objective.You're trying to get in your in a specific campaign.So you would have it as a secondary conversion action.Um, where but you can choose it as a you can either do it as a custom goal.You can make it a primary conversion action.Um, but then all your campaigns will be optimizing.It's kind of like a default.It'll be optimizing for newsletter signups, which you do not want.So we would recommend doing it as a secondary action and then creating a custom goal and optimizingfor that specific goal.If you're not seeing around 50 conversions per month to properly inform the algorithm.So this is like a rough number to work with.But essentially you want to be able to use, um, you want to be able to train the system.So maybe you're just not getting any purchases right now.You're brand new and you want to be able to train the system with something.So maybe you start with a secondary conversion action as your main campaign goal.If you, you know, maybe you do add to carts as your main campaign goal just to get some data in thesystem.Let it start optimizing, let it start bidding, let it start learning, and then you switch it to apurchase down the line.So those are some examples.Sometimes advertisers will do it.It's not so common or so typical.The best case scenario is getting enough conversion volume to optimize for your primary.What you really want, not your indirect conversion actions.Because the system will get very good at learning the type of person who takes actions that aren't directlyattributed to your business goal, but may not, um, and who may never actually directly attributeto your business goal.So it's something that's more supplementary.Um, or you just want to kind of track it and keep an eye because it's indirect, right?So if let's say you're seeing a campaign, you just launched it and it's a new test, and you don'tknow if the you don't see any purchases coming through, but you want to look at some more like secondaryconversion actions, maybe you're going to look at add to carts and check out initiated.Um, to get a sense of is this does this campaign have potential or is there no add to carts, no checkoutinitiated, and you already spent $500.Maybe that's a question you should start asking, right?So, like, it is a good way for us as advertisers to take a look at the data.But again, these these bullet points are only using secondary conversion actions as your main campaigngoal.If right we we talked about it focuses direct on actions other than direct sales.You're not seeing 50.You're not seeing 50 conversions or enough conversions to properly inform the algorithm.Your conversion cycle extends beyond the 90 day cookie tracking period.Um, if you have a long lead cycle, it takes a year for you to actually convert leads.Then you're not going to want to use, um, your primary conversion action as your campaign goal.You're going to want to use your secondary.Maybe if you're a law firm, I don't know, could take months for people to actually become a closeddeal.So you're going to want to optimize the campaign for something that's more of a secondary campaign goal.You can make it your primary campaign goal.Don't get confused.You can make it your primary campaign goal.Um, there's different ways you could set that up, but you typically will have.If something takes more than 90 days, you use it more as a secondary conversion action.You're not using it as an account default goal.Um, because it's beyond the conversion cycle, you might want to test micro conversions to gain a competitiveedge.So we talked about micro conversions or secondary conversion actions.Um, let's say, you know, this is the this is the perfect audience.Anyone who does this type of keyword is exactly what we need.We need to get more of that.Our, um, the way the auction works, right?You we discussed it with Isaac.You'll learn about it with Isaac beforehand.But let's say you're expected.Conversion rates really low.so maybe a way to get get a competitive edge is by optimizing for a micro conversion.A secondary conversion maybe it really is add to cart.And all of a sudden you're you're expected conversion rates so much higher than your competitors.So your ad rank is much higher.Um, so you might be able to gain a competitive edge that's like not so common.People don't typically do this because there's reasons that your competitors are able to bid on primaryconversion actions.I would look at it more of like, what's wrong in the business?What's wrong with something else, rather than potentially pushing to micro conversions.Um, but just my own thoughts there.Um, but you always want to track micro conversions as secondary goals for improving reporting and analysis.So you want to be able to analyze the data, um, you want to be able to understand it.Also, Google does take into consideration some of this stuff on the back end.It helps feed the system.So you do always want to track it.Um, and you set it as a secondary conversion action, which would be more of your micro conversions.You're setting it as secondary.So that's secondary conversion actions.Then next I want to talk through the anatomy of a Google Ads conversion action.So you're going to have the conversion name at the top your primary versus secondary conversion action.That's where you're going to set that up in the action optimization the value you can use dynamic versusstatic.You can use different values of this.You're going to set up through conversion tracking to dynamically pull in the revenue amount.So let's say someone made a purchase per, you know user A their their total purchase came out to $50.User B came out to $100.So you're going to want to be able to know the difference.This user this conversion action generated $50 in revenue.This one generated $100 in revenue.Um, sometimes there's a static value.You might want to be adding.So maybe.And that's maybe let's say.Value based bidding would be okay.I have an SQL, an SQL based on the conversion rate differentiation.Um, an SQL is worth to us $200.So you might want to use, you know, set a specific value.Um, you can also say if there's no value coming through, sometimes the value doesn't come through.For some odd reason.You can use your average order value.Maybe you want to put that in there.The source from where this conversion action is set up.So, um, you know, it'll be through the website.In this one you can track every conversion versus one conversion.This is an important piece.So pay attention.Every conversion.So let's say I had a user, um, who made two purchases.Two Who purchases?Do I want to track all those those two conversions, or do I want to just track one of those?In that scenario, I want to track every conversion because both of them attributed to revenue.But if I was a lead generation client and, um, I had a form fill and someone was like just annoyingand filled out five form fills because on different parts of the site, they wanted to get in touchreally fast.And do you want the system to be able to say, oh, this click turned into five form fills?This is awesome.Let's continue to get more people like that.I don't know if you want that, but you can choose to have the system track it as one.Conversion only one, no matter how many times they called, no matter, no matter how many times theyfilled out the form, only track it once, but with purchase.Typically you want to do every click versus engaged versus view through window.So a click through conversion window means, let's say someone clicked on your ad and they convertedfive days later.Great.That, um, whatever campaign they clicked on, whatever ad they clicked on, that campaign ad willget credit because it was in with within a 30 day window you have up until 90 day, I believe clickthrough conversion window.Um, we typically set it at 30 days, but maybe if you have a longer lead cycle, you want to do a 90day click through conversion window.Engaged view conversion window.That means that this would be typically something with YouTube, or maybe demand gen campaigns wherethey kind of engaged with it.Um, maybe they kind of scrolled through or did something where they engaged, but they didn't clickwith the ad.You might want to put in a three day engaged view conversion window.Um, view through conversion window means they saw the ad they did not click at all, and they convertedwithin whatever time period.So if you're running YouTube campaigns, we typically extend this beyond one day view through conversionwindow.And maybe we'll do it to a week, seven days.So if someone viewed an ad on YouTube, converted, you know, came back, converted, um, later ondirectly, we would still and let's say three days later, we would still.YouTube would still get that credit because it was a view through conversion that happened within sevendays or whatever.We set it to, um, and then we talk through attribution.So this is the anatomy of a Google Ads conversion action.Um, when you set one up, you'll be able to see all these different options.And then we'll go into the Google Ads account momentarily and I'll show you also, um, but these theseare the different points that you're going to want to set up.Make sure it's accurate and focus on when you're creating a conversion action.We talked before about optimizing for multiple conversion actions, whether that's multiple primaryand secondary conversion actions with like a custom goal.So a custom goal is made up of a variety of conversion actions you've defined as important and can beapplied to any campaign.So you would go under the conversions.In the summary tab, you'll see custom goals, and you could click whichever ones you want to createa specific campaign goal.So let's say you have a YouTube campaign and you want.Ideally you want to get purchases.But like you know, that might not happen, um, in your setting because like the the average ordervalue is so high, it's just not going to be like that.So maybe you're going to optimize for add to cart, initiate a checkout and purchases so that at leastyou're getting some data into the system to kind of feed it down that that path, instead of just optimizingfor purchases, which would have no data really attributed to that campaign.So just like a thought, we don't necessarily go this route because micro conversions are just not thedirect business outcome, and the system can get pigeonholed into saying, ah, this type of user performsreally well.Um, but really it's an indirect and they never actually directly, um, attribute or directly helpthe bottom line of the business.Um, I will show you also in the Google Ads dashboard where this is, but just know you can set thisup as a custom goal, and then you could optimize any campaigns, you could set up multiple custom customgoals, and you could optimize many campaigns for different custom goals.Um, we're going to talk through phone call tracking, and then we'll go into the Google Ads dashboard.So understanding phone call tracking.So more on the lead generation side.Um, you want you do want to track phone calls.So there's two different types of phone call tracking.There's calls from ads and calls from website.So calls from ads.Um, this would be every call received from a call extension or from your Google My Business listing.As a best practice, we recommend optimizing for call length of a minimum of 90s, so this will avoidto limit the amount of spam calls or unqualified calls so you can set it up as um, only add this tomy conversion action and say this is a conversion action.Um, a call from AD if it lasted 90s that typically means that this was a somewhat of a qualified leadversus or qualifying call versus a two second call where someone was like, oh, wrong number, andthey hanged up.But Google was tracking that, um, and counts that as a conversion, which is not true.And you don't want that.And you don't want to get more of those either.Um, calls from website.This is a bit more complicated to set up and will generally require a paid call tracking software.We love callrail call tracking metrics.There's also what converts is a bunch of them.And then there's Google a Google free solution.But the way these systems work is they dynamically create numbers, and then they're able to track itand kind of plug in the different numbers.So let's say I have a landing page, um, for a law firm.And on the law firm landing page, we have a phone number.The way these systems work is they swap out the phone number.So if you and me are on the landing page at the same time, we're each going to see different phonenumbers, um, so that they are able to track who came from what and then put that data back into thesystem.And those, let's say Callrail will send that information to Google ads that this person made a phonecall, and it's able to attribute it to which campaign, which ad, which keyword.So using a call tracking tool allows you to a you can put value to calls.Um, and it also allows you to limit the calls you're counting as a conversion on Google to only qualifiedcalls.So let's say you have this call tracking software, um, and you have five phone calls come throughand only one of them is actually qualified.So the support team is going to mark that off as this one was qualified.So you could set it depends how you set up your call tracking system.But you can set it up as only track um qualified leads only send that information to Google.So then it'll send that information into Google versus it won't send the four phone calls if you'reusing, um, other type of solutions or not.A more robust call tracking tool.It you might be only be able to set it up the way we do with calls from ads, which is only send itif it's a 92nd or 32nd, or even a phone call.Right?So then you're sending all that information to Google.But that's not ideal.So using these call tracking softwares allows you to attribute value to calls and does allow you to,um, tell the system and optimize for more qualified calls.You can optimize for multiple conversion actions to get more conversions or conversion value in thesystem.So you can optimize for calls from website, calls from ads.Form fills all of that.You should be tracking to get more conversions into the system.But keep in mind, I think with phone call tracking is more associated with lead generation clients.If you're tracking phone calls for an e-commerce client, you could track them, but not necessarily.Do you want that?Because that might just be more, um, you know, customer service type of calls?Um, it depends.It depends what your business model is if your business model is people, you're still an e-commercesite, but people can't really shop online.They have to kind of call and speak with a sales rep.Then you want to be tracking the phone calls.Um, it depends what your ultimate business objective is.And the main action that people you want people to take.But keep in mind that, let's say with a lead generation client, you have a form fill and you havea phone call available on your site.Sometimes your sales team is so good that you want people to really call.You don't want a form fill so much, so you want to be optimizing for phone calls more than form fills.So maybe form fills you do as a secondary conversion action.So you're tracking it, but you're not optimizing for it.If you're optimizing for phone calls, the system is going to try to get you more phone calls.Um, so that's a great way to understand that.I know on the back end this is where, you know, advertisers and feeding the system and speaking tothe machine Helps, um.Do it.Helps the system do better for you.Right.So you want to say.Okay, we know that typically calls our sales team again is so good.These calls convert at a much higher rate for the ultimate business objective that we want.So let's try to get more phone calls then form fills.So like you can set things up in a way that really, um, takes all your business objectives into consideration.All the real business outcomes allows it to feed into the machine so that the machine can say, oh,this type of user is awesome.It's great.They're they're likely to make a phone call.They're they're exactly in the market for what they're looking for.Let's go bid after this user more aggressively than the user that um, maybe would just is more likelyto do a form fill.So that's just like a simple, very simplified example.More anecdotally, um, but this is a great way for you to understand the main primary conversion actions,secondary conversion actions, the anatomy of a Google Ads campaign and not a Google Ads campaign,a Google Ads conversion setup and phone call tracking.Those are all important elements of setting up successful conversion tracking in your account.I'm going to quickly walk into the conversion tracking dashboard just to show you guys what it lookslike, so you're not lost when you go in.Welcome back.Um, okay, so I opened up the Google Ads dashboard.You are going to go into the goals section.Um, on the left hand side you're going to click summary.And this is where you're going to see your conversion goals.So in this account we have a purchase.Let's say the conversion action for example is a big purchase.It's a primary conversion action.The conversion source website.We're going to see all the conversions that are attributed and you have the time period and then theall conversion value.So let's go into it just so you guys could see you have the details of it.Right.So you can go into Edit settings um purchase primary purchase action.It's using different values.If it doesn't have it um then use the average order value of $1,500.Um, your accounting every conversion versus one click through conversion we're doing 45 days, threedays engaged view um, one week view through because we're running YouTube data driven attribution because,um, because of the attribution model that is recommended.Enhanced conversions is not configured, but it should be configured.Um, we can do that through conversion settings, which we will talk about shortly.Um, diagnostics.This is the consent mode is implemented and modeled conversion tracking is set up, which we will talkabout also in one of our techniques.And then this is a great one.Um, this is my favorite the web pages section where you can actually see and break down, um, theweb page that happened, um, the tags that fired, how many conversion actions or what percent of theconversion action is actually attributed the conversion value.So sometimes you may want to troubleshoot different things and you'll be like, what is going on.Where is this conversion actually conversion action actually firing.So this is where you could see the different pages that it's firing on.The conversion value that's attributed.Maybe something's off.Maybe something's wrong.So you can analyze here.And then there's like the tags setup.You can install the tag yourself um through HTML tracking.And it's the event snippet.You can do it on the page load.So for example, if it's a thank you page, um, you can do it through this.Typically you use more of a developer with that.Um, you could email the tag to your developer or use the Google Tag manager, which uses the conversionID and conversion label, which is great.The conversion ID is associated with your whole account.The conversion label is set up that when this tag fires in Google Tag Manager, send it to Google Adsand that's where you have the conversion label.Um, let's go back to conversion goals for a minute.So you have add to cart um call clicks from ads, shopping app, add payment info, begin checkout allof these different things.Um, then you have YouTube channel subscriptions.This is one that's like automatically created.Then you have a bunch of different options.Here's where you do custom goals.You add your custom goals.So let's say you want to name this as, um, you know, whatever it is, we're doing all conversionactions.This is add to cart, initiate a checkout purchase.So you're going to click all of those.Let's say these are three.You're going to name your goal.And then when you set up a campaign you'll be able to choose a custom goal to optimize for.And it'll optimize for all those three actions.Um, this campaign specifically, this account specifically is very high AOV.It's done through, you know, a lot of phone calls.Um, there's there the purchases that are actually attributed aren't at such a high volume.So we are optimizing for some add to carts and initiated checkout as a primary conversion action.Um, but there's reasons behind it.And we've tested different things.So, um, there's, there's different actions here.But the other thing that you can take a look at is, um, ga4 syncing this up from Google Analyticsfour, and then you're able to kind of see the breakdown and, um, making sure things are trackingright.With Ga4 and Google ads, you're able to see the difference there.So you could optimize for the ga4 event.You could optimize, um, for the regular website, one that you set up.Now, let's say you want to create a new conversion action.There's different ways you could set it up.So the app setting, the phone calls, you could do calls from ads, calls to number on your website,clicks on number on mobile sites.So, um, if you're doing click to number on your website, you can sync this all up with you can followyour phone call tracking software's, um, instructions to how to set that up, calls from ads.Also, you'll put in your phone number that you want, um, import data from Google Analytics, Salesforce,offline lead conversions, phone sales.So there's you can kind of set up a conversion action for these more offline or imported type of actions.Um, and then you'll be able to track that here.But website is you know, typically you can also put in let's walk through what the process looks like.So you have the create the conversion action.Let's say we want to track a purchase.So you're going to put in your website domain.Um one minute.Let's say we wanted to do adventure PPC.Com.So this is where you you enter in your domain.Um, and it'll scan your website to try to find conversion action.So tried creating some conversion goals.Um, let's say it was a contact on the web.Someone visits a page starting with adventure, PPC, com slash, contact or page you of about or someonevisits a page with a blog like no thank you.Um, so you can you can either accept the suggestion or you can add conversion actions manually.And then once you're done setting this all up, you'll be able to get, you know, the right code,um, to to add to Google tag manager or to the website directly.Um, but you're going to choose the type of category that the action falls under.Um, there's more.Some of them are automatically like a purchase.One is automatically an account default goal.So let's say you want you have a it is a purchase, but you don't want to really be using it as a primaryconversion action.Maybe you can choose other and then it'll um you want to choose that.Let's say page view.You can do it as a secondary one.So it's not an account default goal.Okay.So that's the gist of conversion tracking and navigating the conversion action section of the GoogleAds dashboard.I will see you in the next lesson to discuss tracking technique number three.
