# 23.1 Navigating The Google Ads Dashboard

You Edwards fans and will you back up and running with Google outwards in this chapter we're going totalk about the Atwood's dashboard and give a detailed overview of all the different buttons tabs menusthat you're going to encounter in the back end to google adwords what we call your dashboard.We're back in our pop and campaign.This is the campaign that we've been building and we're going to continue to build it as the coursedevelops as we learn how to make new campaigns new groups.But overall this is how our dashboard looks right now.So let's talk about the different areas of this screen here the top we have are our what I call ourtop level menu.We have a few different tabs and the area you're going to spend the vast majority of your time is goingto be in this campaign's tab or this campaign's page.Most often that's going to give you an overview of everything that you have running in your accountto the left of campaigns.We have home the home page is going to give you a broad overview of what's going on in your accountsand give you some suggestions.It's more of a customizable module that will allow you to see a broader kind of 40000 level 40000 footoverview of your entire accounts.Let's jump into the home page and see what that looks like.So here we are on the home page and as you can see right away we're seeing a lot of zeros.That's because we don't have a lot of data running in this account.If we just zoom in a little bit here we'll be able to see that we could select which campaigns we wantto see data for.We could do all non-active campaigns on the campaign so on and so forth we could choose our keep oureyes our key performance indicators that we want to compare and contrast with each other.So we can choose all the different key performance indicator for example Clix we do verse impressionsclick through rate average cost per click.Things of that nature and then in this performance graph we can customize it day week monthly quarterlyas the campaign continues to get start getting data.You'll have modules here like good quality but low traffic keywords that's going to be a keyboard witha high quality score.And as you can see we have both basically all of our keywords fall into that range once again becausewe don't have any data yet.I could also close out of this module minimize the module.Things like that.And I could see all enabled keywords on the campaigns.So it's kind of a broader overview in kind of an analytics dashboard if you will for your entire campaign.That's the home the home page.Once we start getting data we'll take a look at some other accounts that have data to see what thislooks like.But overall it's not in the area of the account that you're going to be spending so much of your timein just because you're not actually managing anything from here you just kind of getting a overviewof the data and all these different data points are available from within the campaigns page under differentin different tabs.So let's go back over to campaigns and to the right of campaigns we have something called opportunities.Opportunities are basically Googles suggestions or different ways you could optimize your account campaignsKeyword Adwords so on and so forth.If we go into our opportunities page we're going to see a message that says no opportunities right now.That just means that there's not enough data accrued in the account for them to give us any opportunities.We'll go take a look at a live account and see what that looks like in another campaign.So let's go jump over into a client account and take a look at what exactly what that looks like.So here we are back in the opportunities page of a client account and we can see that there are someactual suggestions.So the first suggestion they show us optimizer ad rotation to show your best ad and get more conversionsand they want us.Google wants us to change one of our campaign settings to optimize the ads around conversions as opposedto around clicks and it's telling us that we can get 150 more clicks for more conversions when we changeor advertisement for one campaign before we apply this suggestion even if I just in case I do want toapply it I could click View opportunity and it will show me the actual campaign and the actual settingand wants me to change things too.So he wants a change or adaptation something to optimize for convergence for this campaign.The cool thing is I can actually go ahead and click apply and that setting will be change.I don't want to you know make that setting now so I can click go back and see my other opportunities.Here's another interesting opportunity where I can add keywords to search network campaigns to reachmore customers.It's suggesting that I'll get around eight thousand more impressions when I add 81 new keywords crossfive AG groups.And if I click on View opportunities it'll actually show me the five ad groups they want me to add newkeywords to and they're actually going to show me the keywords as well that they want to add to thosespecific campaigns so I could click View for this one here and it'll show me the 20 keywords they wantto add.I could select or de-select as I'd like I can just choose one or two and I could go ahead and applyif I like any of these cuarto suggestions.So while some of these key words are really bad they would not be good for my account they would notbe good for our potential customers.Some of them might be really good.And then here's another opportunity where I could rate they're asking me to raise my daily budget from$200 a day to $600.So that's not going to happen that's not exactly what we want to do.But I could once again hit apply or view more details for these suggestions.When it comes to a budgetary consideration I can choose to add it by $75.I you know I could I can stick with my current I could go up to $130 day $210 a day and it shows meestimates estimates of how many more clicks impressions and cost my campaigns and account will accrueif I apply or you know the suggestion if I don't want to apply the suggestion I guess simply hit dismiss.And that suggestion will be gone.So that's the opportunities page.You most of the times are not necessarily going to want to just blanket kind of add these apply thesuggestions because Google is not taking into account your specific marketing goals.They don't know your customers.They don't really know your products they're just basing this on the other keywords in your campaigns.So you definitely want to look at the opportunities page what you want to be very very careful beforeapplying any of these opportunities to your account.You want to be very careful.Think about it and be and use your own judgment and common sense.That's the most important thing to keep in mind.That's the opportunities page.That's a really cool area account.And you could definitely get a lot of good information there.Let's go back to our pop in campaign and let's go over to the reports page the reports pages somethingwe're going to dive into in a later video but it's an area of the account that's going to show you alot of your data and it's going to allow to give you different types report so if we go once again we'renot we don't have any data in the popping campaign.But if we go over back to this client account I mean click on reports we're going to see a whole differentstory.So they're going to give me some basic reports that I could run myself or could create these very poortemplates or I can go ahead and create reports myself if I would if I went to click Adoree port I havedifferent types of tables and charts that I could generate I could generate a pie chart a pie charta bar chart a line chart or a table and then I could go ahead and select all the different types ofdata.And not going dive into that now because we'll look at reports later in a different chapter under theTools page.We're going to get a dropdown menu that's going to ask us to select which tool we want to go to.So we could see that change history to which the tool that's going to show us all the different editsand changes that the that was made to the account accountant will have the opportunity to remove orundo most of those changes which is very cool.Kind of like a history tool.It is a history tool rather a tool called conversions and we're going to go into conversions in moredetail when we talk about setting up conversion tracking and tracking conversions in our account attribution.Jump into that further Google Analytics.If our Google Analytics accounts are linked I'll be able to go to my Google Analytics page who willMurton Center this is where your shopping field will be set up if you're an e-commerce store and you'rerunning Google Shopping campaigns.This is not relevant for our video so we're going to skip this one.The keyword planner which is that we have seen already and we and we kind of talked about the utilityand the uses of the key word planner.The display planner is a tool that is very similar to the keyword planner but it allows you to get ideasfor display placements and display campaigns.So this course is primarily focused on Google Search campaigns which are the most common and successfulform of Google ad campaigns.So we're going to skip the display planner and the ad preview in diagnosis tool.It's a really really cool tool that we're going to give a separate dedicated video to a little bit laterin this course.But those are the different options under the Tools tab.So now that we've covered our top level menu Let's go back to campaignsand let's talk about some of the tabs with in the campaigns tab.First and foremost as we've seen already we have the left hand menu over here which is expandable andcollapsable so I can collapse it to get myself some more viewing room and I can also click on the arrowjust hover over it and expand it.If I click on the double Chevron double arrows it will remain open.Down here we have our shared library the shared libraries can allow us to create remarketing audiencesbidding strategies shared budgets campaign negative keyword lists and so on and so forth.We'll talk about a few of these options at a later chapter.Bulk operations is something which we're going to use very little especially in this video these aregenerally more advanced options in terms of adding automated rules scripts things of that nature willtouch upon those things but we'll cover them in more depth in a more advanced course.Reports these are the different right under here these are the different reports that you've saved thatyou're running so if you if you when we create a Google report and we schedule it to run and down ordownload or be sent via e-mail to a specific person or at a specific time we'll be able to manage thoseschedule reports over here.And once again we have labels so labels our labels are a way to organize campaigns keywords.AG Rupes if for example we wanted to label five of our campaigns that are targeting the U.S. we wantedto label those USA campaigns we could do that and we can manage our labels over here.So let's go back to all campaigns because this is where we're going to be spending most of our timeand when you're managing your account and you're building your account and you're optimizing your accountthis is where you're going to essentially be if I'm selected if I have all campaign selected.This is a very important thing to keep in mind if I have all my campaign selected then everything thatI navigate to is going to be showing me information for all campaigns.So for example if I had a few campaigns here right now we have one but if I had a few campaigns hereand I hit this ad groups tab it's going to show me all the ad groups in all the campaigns.If I click over here on pop in USA furniture it opens up my and groups as a dropdown list in my lefthand menu and it automatically navigates me to my groups tab.And now I'm just going to be seeing add groups for this specific top in USA furniture campaign.That's an important distinction to note when you're looking at your data through this navigation throughthese tabs over here whenever you have left over here is the level you're going to be seeing that information.So once again if have all campaigns selected and I go to add groups I would be seeing all my ad groupsfor all my campaigns.I've had additional campaigns.I would be seen those groups as well.But once again we'll we'll see that with more accuracy when we actually have some new campaigns addedwhich we're going to do in the very next video.So I'm in all campaigns so I can go to my campaign and see all my campaigns here.Groups is very self-explanatory it's all my aggregates settings is where I can go ahead and change mycampaign settings so I could click on I have a sudden you under settings I have all settings locationswill show me my location settings for each campaign I can add locations and change locations from thisfrom this report.My ad schedule is my custom and schedule.When my ads are set to run over here there's scene there is a schedule that's set up to run from MondayTuesday and Wednesday and we're going to talk about Cousins scheduling in their own video and deviceswork is where I could set big adjustments based on device.I could increase or decrease my mobile device a bit so if I want if I if I like mobile traffic and Iwant to advertise more aggressively or mobile I could make it big adjustment and increase my bid formobile devices if I wanted to decrease my bit adjustment for mobile devices I can do that as well.If I did not want traffic if I did my ads showing on mobile devices.Currently there's no way to change the adjustment for computers desktops or tablets.I could only edit and adjust to manipulate my mobile adjustment.The ads tab is self-explanatory This is where it shows me all my ads.This is where I would come to change my ads have wanted to write new ads.AB split test my ads see that data for the ads.This is where I would go I would go to the ads tab keywords is showing me all the key information eitherfor all campaigns or for just the specific campaign I had selected.And this is the area where I could start you know really drilling down into which keywords are spendingthe most which keywords are converting the best which keywords have the highest clicked rate and whichkeywords are costing me the most money.So this is going to be important to audiences is is mainly for remarketing.And we're going to talk about what remarketing is and how to set remarketing up in a future video inthis course.Ad extensions we spoke about what an extension extensions were and this is where you're going to beadding and creating your ad extensions.So if I clicked on new ad extension I could select the campaigns I want to create an addict attentionfor my selecting a campaign click and done.And then now I can add some site extensions and cancel that out and I can add different types of extensionsso I could go to the way I would add different extensions as by selecting the type of extension I wantto create or edit in this dropdown menu so I can create a location extension call extension app extensionreview extensions call it extensions structured snippet extensions with the sun which is something you'regenerally not going to worry about an automated and view my automated extensions report which are theextensions that Google generates for us.I also have the option of creating ad group extensions or campaign extensions.If I create site link extensions at the ADD group level then the site links will only apply to a specificgroup but I can also create site link extensions or call extensions at the campaign level which basicallytelling Google all the ads in all the groups in this campaign should have these site or these extensionsextensions attached to the ads in that campaign and don't have to be specifically to the group if itwanted to get really detailed inserted at groups should have certain extensions.So for example if I have an Agard that's talking about padded furniture and I have a few different pageson my site that sell different types of padded furniture I might want to have just add extensions forthat AG group with different cyclings leading to the specific types of padded chair pages on my site.Just as an example
