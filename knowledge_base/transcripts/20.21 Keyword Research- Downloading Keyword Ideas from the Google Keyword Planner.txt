# 20.21 Keyword Research- Downloading Keyword Ideas from the Google Keyword Planner

How do Google ads fans and welcome back in the last lecture we spoke about.Different ways people talk to search engines.In this lecture, we're going to sort of complement that information with learning about the buyersfunnel and then sort of combining the two things together and how they both work to really understandyour keywords in a very sophisticated way.And let's talk about the buyers funnel, and we're going to jump into a slide that I have prepared.Fundamentally, the way a potential customer searches the Internet could help us understand where theyare in the buyer funnel.That's why it's important to understand the buyer funnel, what the different dynamics of the differentstages of the buyer funnel are, and how that could help us figure out how much to bid on on certainkeywords, on certain searches, and also where those searches and keywords should be in the overallstructure of our campaigns and ad groups.There are four stages to the buyer funnel awareness, interest shop and buy.And what's important to understand is that every customer goes through this process every time for everysingle product, no exception.And we can break that down and sort of think about this in the context of different purchases.Now, say, for example, you're buying a car, you mean the market for your car.You might be in the market for a new pair of headphones.You might be in the market for Broadway tickets.Now, each of these items represents drastically different price points and length of the buyer funnel.But in every single one of these cases, if you ultimately buy a Broadway ticket, you buy headphones,you buy a car, you went through all the stages of the buyers funnel.You became aware, you became interested, you shopped around and you bought.Sometimes this happens in a matter of minutes.So for example, a few months ago I was scrolling through a Facebook feed and I saw this this ad forthis really interesting contraption that you were able to customize.It was sort of a lap desk for computers and laptops for when you're on the couch or you're in bed.And it was it was it was like sort of more advanced than your typical computer desk and all the differentways you could configure it for all these different sorts of positions.Had a fold out mouse contraption.I was like, Wow.I was like, I don't even know this thing existed.I didn't even realize that I needed it.I figured out how much it cost, and I bought it literally within the span of 5 minutes.But I went through that entire buyer funnel.I became aware of the item.I became aware of a problem that this item could solve for me.I became interested.I shopped for it, I then bought it and that happened very, very quickly.But if I buy a car, that might start when I'm 12 years old and I see my dream car and I but I can'tafford it.And as the years go on and I'm able to afford, I become more and more interested.And then I start shopping around.And then when I'm 25 years old, I buy it, right?So that could be a ten year buyer's funnel.But you still go through all the stages and if you're buying anything, just think about the last thingyou bought is a good exercise, think about the last thing you bought, and think about all the differentstages of the buyer's funnel that you went through to get there.In every single case, you'll see yourself going through those stages.But let's discuss what each of these stages are.The awareness phase of the buyers funnel really consists of becoming aware of two separate things.It's becoming aware of the problem.That you want to solve and is becoming aware of a potential solution.To that problem.All right.So, for example, let's use again, popping the awareness stage is when I would sort of become awareof the problem that is leading me to want a new office chair or it's leading me to a problem that anoffice chair might be a good solution for.So, for example, if I'm finding out that my back hurts or I move into a new office and I don't havea chair, that's sort of just becoming aware of that problem.Okay.It's I'm consciously aware that there's something lacking.I have some sort of frustration.I have a need.Awareness is also is oh, my back hurts, right?So this could be my back hurts and the solution could be, oh, a better chair, right?That's the solution.And that's sort of all both of these components is really all part of that awareness stage of the funnel.It's not an emotional.Response as much as it is cognitive.So this awareness is much more cognitive in nature and it's very, very hard to get somebody to buysomething from you when they're just in the awareness stage y because they're not interested yet.They're not expressing that they're ready to purchase.They're not saying, I want to shell out any cash.They're not saying I want to expend any effort.They're just cognitively it's a it's not it's a non emotional state.There's they're consciously cognitively aware that there's an issue that they want a solution for andthat there potentially is a certain solution to their problem.That's all part of the awareness phase of the bias funnel.And again, you go through that every time the interest stage is saying, oh, okay, now that I knowthat I have this problem, now that I know that there's potential solutions, right?And that potential solution is potentially a chair.I'm now interested.I now want interest is synonymous with want.I'm now motivated to go and pursue a potential solution and that interest phase is much more emotionalin nature.Och, it's the interest stage where you could start.Making money and potentially converting visitors, although it's the shop and buy phases of the funnelwhere you have the greatest likelihood.So to draw it out, I would say awareness is a no go for advertising interest.People who are searching for things that that reveal that they're still in the interest phase or thatthey're in the interest phase of the bias funnel should really be educational content.Because they're still really haven't pursued any activity which is related to buying.They're just emotionally interested in in a solution.That's interest.I know I have a problem.I know that there are potential solutions and now I am sufficiently motivated to find one.And remember remember the Fogg behavior model, right?This is always important.Be equals, motivation, ability and a prompt or a trigger.All right.So remember that Fogg equals B equals math, B equals math doesn't make a difference that where whena person starts becoming interested in finding a solution, how they progress and how quickly they progressthrough the buyers funnel and how favorable that progression through the buyers funnel is going to beultimately for you is going to be a factor of how well you could trigger them to move from interestinto shopping and from shopping into buying for your brand.That's that's obviously important factor.So are they lacking in motivation?Are they lacking perceived ability?Is it perceived?Do they perceive your product services to be too complex, etc., etc.?Those are all the things that we spoke about in the behavioral model.So that's interest shop is when I'm now I now want I'm sufficiently motivated and now I am now in theprocess of looking.If if awareness is is cognitive and interest is emotional.Shopping is physical.OC.It's a physical manifestation of the previous two steps.It's I become cognitively aware, I'm emotionally involved, and now I'm physically going and lookingfor it.I'm looking for I'm looking for solutions.I'm now evaluating.I'm comparison shopping.I'm looking at different brands.I'm doing online searches.I'm speaking to friends and family members.I'm looking at reviews and testimonials.I'm looking at different prices in the market.Right?I'm looking at all these different things.I'm physically pursuing the solution to my problem.Again, you have cognitive, you have emotional, and now you have physical.And buying is just that final step.It's a culmination of all the last three, and that is what I call making a decision.So you have awareness, becoming cognitively aware that there's a problem to be solved, what potentialsolutions might be, and potentially in that awareness phase you're sort of researching, I might begoing to Google researching what could be the problems of BAC.Could it be could it be a chair?Could it be something else?Could it be a diet?It could be sleep.Could it be strength, training, whatever it may be.Right.Awareness is sort of all the different stages that go into becoming aware of a problem.Interest is, oh, okay, now I know what my problem is.I know that there's solutions out there.I emotionally want to find that find that solution shopping.Now I'm physically looking and physically comparing.I'm physically and physically doesn't necessarily mean going into a store.It it means like I'm actually physically looking I'm acting on my emotional desire that that was expressingthe interest phase and buying is when you make that final decision.I've chosen the solution I want.I've chosen the vendor, I've chosen the product.I have committed to, to a solution.And now I am making the decision.And our job is to have that money as a result, be in our pockets.At the end of the day, those are the different stages of the buyer's funnel.Let's think of a couple of different keyword examples of sort of what might be reflective of a differentstage of the bias funnel.So let's say awareness, right?Okay.So let's say a person goes to Google and he searches for back pain, right?Back pain.He or she who searches for back pain isn't really expressing interest in any specific product he mightbe.There's a remote possibility.You never know for sure.That's something we'll talk about in the next lecture.You'll never know for sure.But certainly it's it's a search term that is most likely reflective of a person who's in the awarenessstage of the funnel.He's becoming aware of problems.He's okay.I have a problem with with with my back and potential solutions such as so on and so forth.And let's say, you know, somebody searches for.Chairs for bad backs.Let's say that's a keyword.Chairs for bad backs.Well, this could actually be somebody in the interest phase.It could also be somebody in the awareness phase.This could be somebody who's trying to figure out, is our chairs a type of product that could helpsolve a bad back?But a person could also be saying, oh, now that I, I know already the chairs are for bad backs,I'm now interested in finding chairs that are specifically marketed, that are specifically designedto help bad backs.That's sort of the interest.And that could even be entering into the shop phase of the funnel as well.Again, not any one given keyword is is specifically reflective of any one stage of the buyer's funnel.But there's usually you could usually peg it to one or two different phases of the funnel.The shopping stage of the funnel would be a keyword like buy.Desk chairs right now.He's now he or she.Who's who's who's performing the search isn't necessarily any more expressing the type of problem orthe type of solution they're looking for.Such a search like Best Buy desk chairs for falls more into that informational query category.But they certainly are using the word buy, which indicates that they're shopping, that they're lookingright.And by the by seat of the funnel is not actually is not actually tied to any specific query.It's actually the the action that a person makes after clicking on an ad and deciding that they wantto buy one of our products.Lastly, it's worth pointing out that queries go from general to specific as customers become more educatedabout our products and services.Like we said in the awareness stage, right?If somebody who's searching for, you know, back pain.That's pretty generic.But if somebody in the lower lower end of the funnel in the shop stages, he's like, okay, buy lumber.Support.The chairs write really hyper specific searches and that's typically the progression you see that'svery common.And what else is worthwhile to note is that your click through rate.Increases, it gets higher as you go down the funnel.So awareness will have the lowest click the rate.Once you're at the shop phase, your click the rate is going to be the highest.And up here in the awareness stage, your click through rate is going to be the lowest.Well, why is that really simple?And by now, you guys should have the answer, because while you're in the higher phases of the funnelawareness, there are so many different things a person could mean.If a person just searches for back pain, it might be worth it for pop and to spend a few cents on theclick and sending them to some educational content.And the same thing with your business for top of the funnel.That's what you'll now.You now understand what it means.Top of the funnel.Middle of the funnel.Bottom of the funnel.It's referring to this buyer's funnel awareness interest shot by or awareness interest desire by.You know, people refer to it with some different, different words, but conceptually it's the exactsame thing.And you'll always go through it when you're bidding on these generic terms, like it's just math.So if you have a top, a funnel term, right, let's say it's awareness.Like back pain.We got to get rid of this marker.They're top of the funnel term is back pain.That could mean, let's say, 50 different things, whether there's 50 different products or services.And poppin is only one of them.Right.You might be looking for a doctor.You might be looking for an exercise ball.You might be looking for a gym membership.You might be looking for a better mattress.You might be looking for a foam roller.Who knows, right?There's a lot of things and popping is one.But as you go down the funnel and now you're looking at both.Bottom of funnel search term shop and this is obviously shop related to popping our search terms wouldbe like OC by.Office chairs.Maybe online right now, this maybe there's like ten different things.Maybe it's like I'm looking for some something more expensive.Maybe I'm looking for gaming chairs for an office, or maybe I'm looking for buying in bulk or buyingused or or buying wood, which we don't sell.Right?So let's say there's ten things and maybe pop is one of them, but our click through rate is going tobe higher because there's a greater likelihood just statistically, that we have what they're lookingfor over here.There's a lower likelihood, our rates lower.That's something to also understand and that's something that shouldn't dissuade you.Having a lower click through rate or a higher click rate is fine.You're not bidding the same amount of money.And that's the last thing I want to show you as you go from the awareness to the shop stage, when yougo from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel, you're going to be bidding per click lowerwhen you're at the top of the funnel and you're going to be bidding much more per click on bottom ofthe funnel keywords towards the bottom of the funnel.And that's again, very simple.Maybe one out of 1000 clicks for an awareness keyword will convert or will lead to a sale.Maybe one out of 20 clicks or one out 100 clicks or one out of ten clicks will lead.Maybe one out of ten or one out of 20 or one out of 100 clicks will lead to a sale in a shop keywordtowards the bottom of the funnel or even interest.And then you bid a little bit more over there and how much you're going to bid.Like we said, you're going to have to start off with using your best guess.But as you go through that funnel, as you get more data, as you look at the historic data in youraccount, you'll know exactly what you should be bidding.But you should always make sure that you're bidding much, much more conservatively on keywords thatare reflective of top of the funnel buyers and more aggressively getting more of that, getting as highof an impression share as possible on keywords that are at the bottom of the funnel.And the next lecture, we're going to stay on the slide quickly, see if we could peg our example.Search queries are popping into different stages of the funnel.I think it's really worth spending a few minutes if you feel that you have this set 1,000% completelyperfectly well, go go ahead and skip ahead.Forward.We take no prisoners here and I look forward to seeing you guys very soon.And the very next lecture.
