# 5.2 Audience-Focused Strategies

In this lesson, we're going to talk about audience focused strategies, primarily using audience targeting.When keywords alone don't indicate if a user is in your target audience, rely more on audience targeting.So this is an easy one because the question becomes like, when do I apply additional audience targeting?So if I'm using a broad match keyword structure where I might be searching for, I might be targetingkeywords that are more informational, um, how to do something or where can I find something?Where can I find certain resources or information?Look at your keywords and just do a healthy analysis.Does my do my search terms?Do my keywords represent intent?Enough intent that I know that this person is in my target market, or am I looking am I, um, targetinga broader strategy?And I'll give you a good example.We actually run a lot of advertising campaigns for the adventure Academy and a lot of the search termsand a lot of the keywords that we target are how to run a max campaign.how to, um, leverage smart bidding.What is target CPA?So those are much more informational queries.And they don't indicate somebody who's willing to enroll in premium premium education.So in that that's a good example for layering audience targeting on top of my search advertising.And that leads us to the second point layering audiences with keywords combine audiences and keywordsto bid more broadly.So if I if I'm just using keywords and they're broad, I'm not going to be as free with my budget.I'm not going to give the I might not give the the system as much time to test, because I don't haveany audience targeting on top of those keywords and search terms.So if I layer audiences on top of keywords, this helps reach our target audience with even more looselyrelated terms.So for example, broad match with a high quality audience.So for example, we're using a high quality audience like a customer list.Right.So these are my customers.I'm using a lookalike audience or using detailed in-market segments, or I'm using a combination ofcustomer lists and in-market segments.Now be careful.You don't want to get too broad, but but in theory, we could create multiple layers of audience targetingto narrow the total scope.And on top of that, I'm going to use broad match keywords, which is going to cast a wider net, notnecessarily indicating in-market activity or people who are ready to buy, but because I'm using highquality audience signals, I'm now creating a more comprehensive and more thoughtful approach to whoI'm targeting.Another idea is to use dynamic search ads with a high quality audience.Dynamic search ads gives Google a lot of freedom to figure out what keywords and search terms to bidon.So I'm going to give Google with dynamic search ads, a landing page, my website, and Google is goingto determine, um, what searches they should send to that page depending on the content of that page.So one of the great strategies that we use for e-commerce businesses and service based businesses,lead gen businesses, is sending traffic to blog posts, sending traffic to educational guides, sendingtraffic to FAQ pages on a website.Using dynamic search, Google will read the content of the page.They'll understand the context, what that page is about.But I don't necessarily only want to use dynamic search ads, because that might bring in a very broadamount of traffic.I'm going to use dynamic search ads with a high quality audience on top of it.So you have to ask yourself, do you need to create demand?And if you need to create demand, you might not want to limit with as much audience targeting.Do you need to limit your remarketing to avoid high frequency rates?Right.So if you're running a lot of remarketing, that might not necessarily be a good thing because sometimesremarketing is really effective.But if you're spending too much money on showing too many messages saturating that remarketing audience,that could be wasted budget.So you might want to limit your remarketing to avoid so much frequency.And frequency refers to the number of times an individual a specific person is shown.Your messaging.In the next lesson, we're going to talk about analyzing your audience performance reports and how tosee that in the dashboard.I'll see you right there.
