# 17.2 Ad Group Structure Ideas

How do the Google ads fans and welcome back.In the previous lecture I know that we spoke a little bit about some ad group structure ideas, butI wanted to review a couple of them in a little bit more detail just so you have some context and someideas and you're armed with the best possible strategies as you're going into your campaigns.So again, the first thing I want you to think about when it comes to ad group level structuring isthemes.Themes could be product categories, they could be subcategories, they could be locations.Right?If you have if you're advertising in certain business locations, they could be brands you sell.They could be colors of of a product.They can be services.They can be different parts of a service that can be sub services.They could be events.Right.It could be all sorts of things.The idea is that each category right.If you're an e-commerce company and you sell furniture, then sofas might be a category.Sectionals might be a category, recliners might be a category.But those each of those categories represents a theme because there's a bunch of different keywordsthat are all sort of similar under that top level category.So I'd highly recommend using themes as your first as the first thing you think about if you're strugglingwith coming up with an adequate structure.And I would suggest, again, I mentioned this exercise in the last what are some in the last lecture,but what are some good themes that might work for your business?Some different ways you can break out.And if you want to get some good ideas, by the way, you could do some Google searches for your competition,see how they're potentially breaking out their ad groups.You're obviously not going to see their AdWords account, but you could see by if they're writing specificthings in their ad texts for specific searches, then they're probably structuring their ad groups inthat specific way.You also go back to add extensions, go back to those price extensions, go back to promotion extensions,and look at Google's list of categories as a header.Those are all different examples of themes for what you could potentially use to break out your ad groupstructure as well.Another big ad group structure technique that we've done in the past and I'd like to do a lot, is notusing a pen that doesn't work.Let's try this one is match match type.So match type structuring also works really well.And we haven't spoken about match types yet, but certain types of ways you, you, you match your keywordsto a search term will usually yield better results.So broad match gives you the most volume but the lowest click through rate and the lowest conversionrate exact match gives you the least volume, the most expensive clicks typically, but the highestconversion rate.So why would somebody why would we potentially why would we why would we potentially break out our adgroups by match type?Well, it allows us to bid differently.Right.At the aggregate level.I might want to bid using, let's say, CPA, bidding target CPA, which we all know that is now forexact match campaigns.I might use manual CPC bidding with for more control for phrase broad match and broad match modified.So that would be a really good way of using aggregate level structuring based on match type becauseI could bid differently.So that's a really useful thing as well.A third way of potentially thinking about aggregate structure is structuring top performers.And this is a really good technique.It's not something which you're going to have in your account right away, but eventually you're goingto start creating ad groups for your top performing keywords.You're going to have these thematically related groups of keywords, right?You're going to have your aggregate broken down by by category or by brand or by product or by color,by event, by price, potentially even.But you're going to eventually see that certain keywords, maybe a handful here and a handful there,one keyword in this category are performing really, really well.There's just this great combination of bid, match type, the search terms, Google's algorithms justwork, working magic and you want more volume.The problem is if I have an ad group with, let's say here's an ad group and I have one, two, three,four, five keywords in it.And let's say this ad group is part of a campaign that has other ad groups in it, and the campaignup here has $100 a day budget.Google is going to try to spread out that $100 evenly across all my ad groups and across all the keywordsin that ad group.Right.So if I could take out some top performing keywords from one of these ad groups and I can make my ownad group called it TF Top I'm sorry.TP Top performers.Then I could give this ad group a more aggressive bidding strategy.I could bid more conservatively on the on, on the, on the ad groups that have all the poorer performingkeywords in it.And then Google will give more volume automatically through the way I set up my bids to my top performingkeywords.I might also eventually want to create campaigns that are just my top performing keywords.Then I would add negative keywords to the other ad groups.We'll show you how to set those things up in a future lecture.When we talk about setting up top performer ad groups and top performer campaigns and how to find thosetop performers as well.But why would you do this again?Volume.When you have a top performer ad group, you'll get more volume for those keywords you'll not get ifyou leave your top performing keyword in search terms.Inside ad groups that are sharing the spotlight with all these other lesser performing keywords, youmost likely not going to get as much volume.Your overall ROAS return on Aspen for the account will certainly increase.Your click through rate for those ad groups is going to go up that's going to result in an increasein quality score is going to result in a decrease in your getting low here and your CPC.All right.And only good things will happen to that.So that's another idea.That's another reason why you might structure your ad groups that way.So using the concepts in the previous lecture, knowing what you understand from just some three differentideas for your ad groups, go and see what you could do and draft out a really good plan and explainwhy you're structuring your ad groups that way.And this exercise can be done either for a brand new campaign or account.It could also be done by by analyzing how your account is currently structured and seeing how you mightbe able to improve it.In the very next lecture, we're going to go back into Google ads, create our very first ad group,and then we're going to get into the exciting topic of writing killer ad copy.I will see you guys in a couple of seconds.
