# 20.20 Keyword Research- Using the Google Keyword Planner 2

How do you relax fans?And welcome back.Thank you for joining me.We're going to continue talking about the Google keyword planner because it's a super exciting tool.And just to briefly follow up with what we were doing in the last lecture, we added in a bunch of interestingkeywords to our keyword plan.We'll talk about more what the keyword plan looks like in a little bit.And we started off by using a URL for Google to generate some keyword ideas.And as you scroll down and again sorting it by average monthly searches, that's sort of what I woulddo.You could see a bunch of these ideas like this is probably ten times more the ideas than I would havethinking of it on my own.And I've done this a lot.I've run a lot of these campaigns.We do this for clients, and you just always see these surprising trends that these keywords have alot of search volume when you might not have thought about it, you sort of have a myopic view.You're in the client's campaign, you're in your own campaign, you're sort of biased based on how yousearch for things, how you talk to search engines.And we're going to in a couple lectures from now, when we talk about keyword planning and the differentstages of the buyer's funnel, we'll talk about all the different ways people speak to search enginesand the Google keyword tool.While it doesn't give you the most accurate data, it's only a sliver of of the real data that's outthere.You start getting a great sense of these additional ideas that were not necessarily ideas that you wouldhave thought of right away.And like a pink office chair, who would have thought it's up there with swivel desk chair and standingdesk chair is another one that I did not think of to have an ad group for.And all of a sudden, as I'm building these out, I'm like, Hey, we have all these new aggregate ideas.We have high back up here.It could be an ad group idea, pink and different colors for different desk chairs.Right.And we're starting to see now we have this potential to build out this campaign from ergonomic and wheeledin general to now 10 to 15 separate ad groups.That all will have thematically related groups of keywords.Really, really, really cool.So this happened to have worked out pretty well for us to use that URL, but say it doesn't, right?Say you put in a URL and doesn't give you so much interesting information.Well, you could go back and search for keyword ideas using, let's say, actual keyword ideas.I could remove the URL and I'm going to add in some keyword.So I'm going to add an office chairs and you add a you add a comma to separate them.Office chairs.Desk chairs.Computer chairs.Leather chairs.Executive chairs.Chairs for offices.And let's see, we get results.So give it a few.I usually give Google a few different ideas to go off of.And now we're getting some new ideas.This is also a tool to be used for negative keywords.When you put in the URL of a website, you're less likely to get good negative keyword ideas becauseGoogle is looking at your actual site to see what you actually sell and giving you some keyword ideas.Now I put in some generic keyword ideas and now the number one search is gaming chair.And this is interesting for two reasons.One is that it's extremely high volume.So that's a great negative keyword to have because we don't sell gaming chairs.So a high volume search that's related to the searches that I put into my account is a really, reallygood negative keyword idea.The other reason why it's such an important thing to understand is because we have keywords in our account.Office chair.A desk chair, computer chairs.Google is showing us that they view gaming chair as a relevant search term to office chair.So if you have a broad match keyword.Office Chair.We may have intuitively suspected that office chair has a broad mat.Search term might trigger a gaming chair, but we might not have known that for sure.Now that we looked at the Google keyword planner and Google shows us that for office chair, they'regiving us a suggested keyword gaming chair.As the number one suggested keyword at the highest volume.We know that if we left office as a broad match without adding gaming as negatives, we're going tobe getting a lot of clicks and a lot of traffic for gaming chair and a lot of ad impressions.So it's a really, really great tool for discovering these excellent negative keyword ideas.Now, we've already added gaming as a negative keyword, but let me just show you how to add it as anegative keyword in your plan, if you were just to select it.We would do more options up here at a negative keyword, negative keyword, broad match and go ahead.And now it's added in plan as a negative and we see that in red under account status.So we're sort of starting to see how useful of a tool this is.And I see another one chair now chair as a broad match is a really, really interesting thing to thinkabout.By itself.Chair is relevant.We sell chairs, but chairs indicates an extremely, extremely wide range of potential products kitchenchairs, gaming chairs, chairs for construction sites, you know, bulldozer chairs.There's all sorts of chairs that are out there recliners, lounge chairs, things that we don't sell.I would bet that, you know, while it's a high volume search, it's not going to be worth it for usto get any clicks for it because it's just too broad and our money could be better spent.So I would want to add this, at least to start as a negative.But what type of negative would I want to add it at?Added, as you guys know all about negative keywords and you guys should be able to tell me right awaywhat negative match type this keyword should be added as if you guessed broader phrase, you'd be wrongbecause then I won't show up for a search for desk chair.I should add chair as an exact match.Negative.So if somebody just searches chair, I won't show an ad, I won't get an ad impression.But Chair could be included in all other types of searches as long as it triggers other keywords.So I'm going to go ahead and click chair.More options, add a negative keyword, exact match.And now it shows in plan as a negative recliner chair.That might be a good one.We do offer reclining chairs for executive chairs on the website.Lounge chairs should be a negative wingback chair.Interesting leather chair, armchair.That's a good one.We didn't have that in the previous one.Best office chair, club chair, oversized chair.We don't sell reading chairs, wooden chairs.So we're starting to get additional ideas that we didn't see before so these ones could be added tothe plans as a broad match.And again, this is just for the sake of.Saving them into the account.And a couple of these negatives like lounge chair, which we don't sell wing back, which we don't sellreading chairs, which we don't really sell wooden chair which we don't really sell sofa chair.I don't know what a kneeling chair is, so we're going to add that as a negative for now.Wing Chair Around chair we do sell.That's a positive drafting.Chair We do sell lumbar support for office.Chair So I'm going to add these first as negatives.Negative broad.And we have a few other positive ones that we could add, like computer desk that's already in the plan.Desk, desk chair.Lumbar support drafting chair.Reclining office chair.High back chair.We'll add those as broad match positives, so don't just use one way of generating keywords from theGoogle keyword planner.As you saw that when we start off with a URL, we get a whole range of ideas.A lot of them were branded, right?And then we whittle them down using filter to just the keywords that include the word chair and thatdidn't include poppin.And we were able to get a bunch of ideas that we didn't know going in.And then once we switched from the URL structure to giving Google some suggested keywords from our accountto spit out some additional ideas, we got a bunch of new ideas and just this five, 10 minutes andit's I'm talking a lot.So it would take a much less time if I was doing this without talking this 5 minutes is time spent that'sgoing to benefit the account forever.Like I might not have gotten these ad group structure ideas and maybe over time I might have added themas an individual keyword.But I wouldn't have started from the get go.Really.Organizing my ad groups and structuring your structuring your ad groups in a professional and organizedand systematic way is incredibly important.It will increase the profitability of your campaigns because it will allow you to have higher qualityscores for your keywords, more specific ad copy, sending your traffic to more specific landing pagesin an area of your site.But most importantly, it's going to allow you to analyze data and make good decisions.And we've said this a bunch of times.Your campaigns are not going to be as efficient or profitable as they're going to be after optimizations.When you first start them, they're going to be wasting some money.That's just how it is.But if you're organized and you could log into a campaign, you could and you could drill into a campaignand see ten ad groups and know quickly which areas are being profitable, what types of keywords areleading to high value checkouts, which keywords in which ad groups are indicating high intent to buyand leading to higher conversion rates?Right.And lower CPAs, you'll be able to then make quick decisions, efficient use of your time and make thesecampaigns much better, much faster.I see all the time I get I do audits of accountants that just have a ton of keywords inside of it.In a group that's totally disorganized, there's no rhyme or reason, and it's no wonder why the campaignsaren't profitable.So that's a few different, really interesting ways of getting keyword ideas for campaigns.Using the Google keyword planner.I want to say one more thing before we go into keyword planning, and that's downloading keyword ideasfrom the Google keyword planner, which is easy enough.So say I have this output over here, I have 125 keywords.I can click download keywords and it's going to generate a CSV report which I could then open up anExcel.And if I click Excel over here, it opens up and I get a bunch of information in this keyword planner.I have things like the keyword, the currency, average monthly searches, the competition, top ofpage rate and over here searches per month of the year.And if you're good at Excel, which I hope you are, you'll be able to use this data and manipulateit with pivot tables, organize it.See how many of these keywords I have in my plan already.Is it in my plan?Is it in my account?Right.So I get a lot of information that I could start manipulating here in Excel.But once we're here, I do want to show you actually one interesting way that I like to manipulate thisdata to get some insight into what I'm building in my campaigns.I'd like to know what are the total estimated monthly searches for all the keywords that are in my plan?Because I'm sort of going through getting these ideas, adding keywords in my plan.I want to get a sense I want to be able to explain to a client or tell my boss or just know for myself.What can I expect to happen if I have a healthy budget and I add the keywords that are in my plan actuallyinto my account and there's a really easy way to do this once this information is in Excel.And that has to do with pivot tables.If you're a pivot table pro, then this will come very easy to you.If not, just follow along.Just follow along with me step by step.We're going to first delete these first two rows.And then I'm going to highlight and I'm going to delete the rows themselves and highlight the entiresheet by using the upper left hand corner.And then I'm going to go to insert pivot table.And click okay because I have my date range selected and there's a few different things I want to dohere.The first thing I want to do is add an average monthly searches.We're going to move things around once we have all the different fields we want to look at.We're going to take a look at keyword.We're going to add keyword in there and we're going to add in plan.Because what I want to know is how many estimated searches per month will the keywords in my plan generate?So the simplest way to do this is just to drag over, count of and plan over to rows.And then I see my row label and if we zoom in a little bit over here is why, right?Shows me the count of keywords.I have 26 keywords in my plan and the sum of average average monthly searches is 24,750.That's a very easy way to manipulate this data in a pivot table.So now I know.Okay.And of all these keywords I just downloaded from Keyword Planner, 26 of them are already in my planand Google estimates that generating 24,000 or that there are 24,000 available monthly searches forthat keyword.Now, let's say I want to get a sense of, okay, well, how many clicks am I going to get?Well, that's not the easiest thing to do, because you have to assume you're going to win a certainamount of impressions.And that's very much due to budget.But we could just say, let's say, for example, that we could win 24,750 impressions for these 26keywords.That's if we gave a complete if we gave the full range of our budget that Google that would allow usto win all those impressions.What information do we need to know?Well, we need to know click through rate.Right.Well, if we know our historic click through rate for, let's say, a certain ad group, then it shouldn'tbe that difficult to get another estimate.So let me tell you one little quick add on to this pivot table.So I'm going to make a column here for KTR, click the rate.And we're going to say, let's say, the historic data for the ad group office chairs.In our account, we have a historic rate of 3.75% right now.It's simple enough we could go and take equals.B four, which is the sum of average monthly searches multiplied by our CAGR of 3.75%.Click Enter and we get 928.125.That would mean 928 clicks.So let's say we can label this column estimated clicks.All right.And this is some interesting things that you can report.You can say, okay, out of the keywords we've added to this plan.And if you're like if you were sort of building out a campaign for a client or you're doing this ina methodical way, this is a really good sort of analysis to look at.So you can start getting these estimates, being able to report on this estimates.It just makes you look a lot more professional.It makes you look a lot more thought through.So that's how to download your keyword ideas into Excel.You could, if you guys know Excel, there's an unlimited way that you can manipulate this data as you'reyou might be downloading 10,000 keywords with thousands of keywords added to your plan.You could estimate click three rate for different ad groups.You could even estimate click the rates for individual keywords.There's all sorts of fun and cool and interesting things you could do, but I wanted to show you howto download that data and encourage you to do it, because once you have that data in Excel, there'sa lot more flexibility and information that you could extract from it in that more flexible format.Just quickly, going back into the Google keyword planner, again, search by URL, search by keywords.There's different things you could do.You could see your history of different search terms.I could remove individual keywords from my search criteria.I could enter in just random phrases, words, different URLs.I could enter in competitor URLs.But again, the structure is the same.Make sure to have your location targeting set properly, your language set properly, the network setproperly.Use these graphs to get to see if there's these either spikes or variations in.In these search results and then start using the Google keyword, the Google keyword output.This report to add ideas to your to your virtual clipboard, your plan, add them as negatives, andthen you can go into your plan and start actually getting more cost estimates of volume estimates ina more a more sophisticated way and then potentially adding them back into your account as actual campaignideas.And we're going to go over all of that when we talk about keyword planning, which is coming up shortly.So thank you for bearing with me through this.I hope that the keyword, the Google keyword planner, is a tool that you really use and really use.Well, there's a bunch of updates in this tool new for for 2018 and 2019.And it's it's actually become a seriously useful tool.A couple of years ago, I really felt it wasn't doing too much of good, too much good for anybody.But I think that's really changed.And I think the main benefit is going to come when I show you some of the new cool tools in the keywordplanner section of the Google Keyword Planner Tool.And with that, we could always go back by clicking the X button and clicking back into our actual campaignand everything we've done is saved.So when we go back to the Google keyword planner, we'll be able to resume these plans that we've beenworking on, see the history, etc..And I look forward to seeing you guys very soon and the very next lecture.
