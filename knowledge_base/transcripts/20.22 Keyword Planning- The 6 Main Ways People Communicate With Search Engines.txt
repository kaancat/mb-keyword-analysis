# 20.22 Keyword Planning- The 6 Main Ways People Communicate With Search Engines

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.So we're talking about keyword research, getting a bunch of different keyword ideas.Now we want to start moving into the phase of keyword planning.It's incredibly important to understand psychology of search.Not all search terms, not all keywords are created equal.And we've been talking about this idea of of what sort of buyer intent does a a keyword or a searchterm describe?Is a person expressing an interest to buy a certain product?Is he expressing an interest to sign up for a certain service?And in these lectures, we're going to start going into more detail about all of those things.And even beyond expressing intent, even beyond commercial intent of a search term, we want to learnabout the different ways people communicate with search engines because.Understanding the different methods that people use to express what they're looking for.And ultimately, that's what it comes down to.People looking for answers for a problem.People want information.They almost always want to find some answer to solve a question they have or some solution to a problem,some some solution to a frustration, something that they if somebody is looking for things to do withkids in Vegas, okay, that's information.I have a problem.I need something to do with my kids in Vegas.I'm going to go to Google and search for that solution.If I'm looking for a car rental company for an upcoming trip to New York, I'm going to go to Googleand look for that solution.If I have a back problem and I know that I have that issue and I don't know different ways to solveit, I'm going to go to Google to look for a solution and understanding the different ways that peoplewill seek that solution, different ways people will talk.We'll give you ideas for search terms and keywords.It will also give you the ability to begin predicting which keywords with search terms are ultimatelygoing to lead to conversions.Which one of those which keywords are going to be the highest value in your account?And it will give you ideas for you to structure your account as well and help you determine what youwant to bid and how much you want to bid for different keywords.And most importantly, it's going to help you build out a very professional, very thorough and a verysophisticated campaign structure.And of course, this all comes down to thematically related groups of keywords.You might group your keywords in aggregates based on themes of products or services.You might also group or even subgroup into additional add groups, products and services based on wherethey are in the buyer funnel or how they're actually searching for for an answer to the problems thatthey have.And this is relevant to every single business.So let's go in.I want to talk to you a little bit about each of the different ways that a person might typically interactwith a search engine.And it's important stuff to know.First and foremost, we need to understand that people communicate with search engines using words,right?People search for answers to their questions in different ways.People seek information in different ways.People feel differently about the problems that they need solved.Let's take a look at an example scenario.Jennifer works as a data analyst for an international agency specializing in telephone poll ad campaignsfor publicly traded companies.Wow, that's pretty exciting.She says she sits in her her hard plastic office chair for long stretches of time, and her back hasbeen seriously bothering her for the past few months.She turns to Google.Now, right there, we know that there is a potential customer for poppin, right.But depending on on how she perceives her problem, what information she knows about potential solutionsand how quickly she wants a solution and what she's intended or what she's committed to invest in asolution could dramatically change the dynamic of the ad auction with regards to how relevant any givensearch that Jennifer performs is for pop and to bid on.So over here we have a broken down by type of query buyer psyche, an example query for pop in and againquery is interchangeable with search term.Buyer psyche is a way to describe the type of search term.Type of search term is a top level category and the buyer psyche is is a way the way to categorize whata person's perception of their problem is and how they're going to the to the search to look for answer.One of the most popular ways is finding an answer to the actual question.So that's what we call problem based searches and an example of a answer to the question, problem basedsearch structure would office chairs with lumbar support.And this is indicating a few different things.This is indicating, first of all, that it's probably a really good keyword for pop.And it conveys to us that not only does Jennifer understand that getting an office chair with lumbarsupport is a is a potential solution, she's expressing that this is potentially the solution that she'slooking for, which sort of does is sort of two good things for us.One, it tells us that she's she's in the market for what we sell.And two, she's expressing an emotional Q or even a rather it's really a physiological cue that she'slooking for something to support her back.There's a and that sort of expresses that there's a great need for the product.Now, this is not the buyers funnel.We're not looking at search terms based on the buyer's funnel.Any of these types of queries won't necessarily for sure lead to better conversion rates or cheaperclicks or more expensive clicks.These are all just different ways that people search.The question itself is another way that people search and the buyer psyche is more explicit, direct.They talk in more specific terms regarding the problem.So how can I fix my back problem from sitting all day?Again, this is another potential search firm that Pop Em would want to bid on.And it's sort of going beyond those typical search search terms that we've been putting in, like officechair, you know, so on and so forth.Now we're getting into the mode of all these exciting search terms that are that are way out on theperiphery.That could mean a lot of different things.But we have to know we have to really determine whether or not this is a search term or a search querythat's going to be good for poppin.Say, for example, we were advertising for a doctor or a chiropractor, a chiropractor, a black doctor,whatever it may be.Now, a doctor might find this search term.How can I fix my back problems from sitting all day a lot more appealing than office chairs with lumbarsupport, whereas poppin is actually the exact opposite pop and finds office chairs with lumbar supportmore appealing.And how can I fix my back problems from sitting all day as more peripheral, less likely to convert?So again, how people perceive their problems, what they're searching for might be a good keyword ora good approach, a good buyer psyche for a certain company or a certain advertiser.And it might be less of a good approach for a different advertiser or a different company.It all depends on what you're selling and what you could extract about the person's likelihood to convertfrom the actual from the actual search term.What are they expressing in their search term?Let's continue on.Description of the problem is another very popular way people search for products.This is what we call symptom based.An example of a symptom based search is my back hurts at work.Now I want to also reiterate that while we might find some of these things surprising, like I personallywould never search my back hurts at work.I typically go to Google when I'm ready, when I understand these, the solution that I want.I'm looking for an office chair.I'm looking for a new monitor.I'm looking for a headphones, I'm looking for recording equipment, I'm looking for a guitar, whateverit may be.I don't usually I don't usually describe my problems to Google, but a lot of people do.So my back hurts at work again for poppin.This might be a search term we want to bid on for the doctor.It's certainly a search term that they want to bid on.Maybe that doctor could convert that person into a new patient, maybe popping can convert that personinto a new customer.And if you go back and remember what we said about peripheral middle of the funnel, this is what wecall top of the funnel query, how important the educational content is, right?So we might not want to send this person to a sales page.We sort of want to send this person to a page on the site that talks about why our office chairs willhelp solve back problems at work.Maybe there's customer maybe there's customer testimonials, maybe there's a case studies, maybe there'svideo walk through about the medical benefits.Right?But all that sort of falls under the category of educational content description of the cause.This is another interesting type of search term type of query.Again, this is also symptom based, but typically this is where the user is giving more information.They're not only talking about the problem they're expressing, they understand why they have this problem.So, for example, my back hurts because I sit for too long in an uncomfortable desk chair.Another person might search, my tooth hurts or I have a toothache.That would be description of the problem, but that wouldn't be the description of the cause.If somebody says my tooth because I ate too much sugar, that would be a description of the cause.And and it and that tells you a lot about that type of person.So say somebody searches for just my back hurts at work, right.And we're popping.We're an advertiser.We're trying to determine whether or not not only whether or not this is a cue that we should bid on,but will this be a good keyword for me to bid on?Will it be a profitable keyword for me to bid on?And where should I where should I send that traffic to?Well, my back hurts at work.We have no idea if a person even understands that an office chair or a chair with good lumbar supportcould even affect back pain.Right?We don't know.Maybe this person is thoroughly convinced that there's no way that her back pain could be solved orcould be caused by a bad chair.In which case that's probably not going to be a customer that we could convert unless we have some extremelyappealing educational content that could help convert that customer.But if a person now searches for my backers because I sit for too long in an uncomfortable desk chair,then we like, aha.This person's expressing that they already understand.They already on their own have come to the conclusion that their problem is a result of having a badchair.And now there's a much greater likelihood that we could get them to buy one of our chairs because they'reexpressing in their search query a description of the cause.And if their description of the cause matches up with what we sell, then that's something which isreally good for us.Now, say again, let's say we're the doctor again.Right.And we're also trying to figure out search terms.In this case, my back my back hurts because I sit for too long in an uncomfortable desk chair.This would actually be not a great keyword most likely for this doctor to advertise on because thisperson is expressing that the issue lies, the cause lies which with the with the chair.But say somebody searched for my back hurts because I have a scoliosis curve in my lower back or myback hurts because I need to strengthen my core or whatever it may be.Then a physical therapist who's bidding on these search terms might say, Oh, okay, now that's a personwho's describing the cause, and in their perception of the cause of their problem, it matches up.There's an alignment with what we actually sell, and that would actually be a good query.Now let's talk about a couple of other very, very popular ways that people search brand name productparts.All right.Now, this is very, very relevant to people who sell other brand names on their site.Do you sell TVs?Do you sell electronics?Do you sell mattresses or other brand name products?You're are you are you a reseller?So these are direct educated buyers psyches.And for example, this would be poppin max mid back task chair This is the specific name, a specificmodel.This is expressing the most amount of buyer intent.So if somebody puts in a brand name that you sell, we have a client that sells sunglasses, very successfulcompany, sell tens of thousands of pairs of sunglasses and eyeglasses off their site.Lots and lots of popular brands like Ray-Ban, Chanel, Oakley, Versace, Dolce Gabbana, etc. Andthe most successful campaigns are when people are specifically searching for brand names, but alsopart numbers.We have a client that has a massive online store of OEM automobile parts, right.And 60% of this conversion, 70% of the conversions are coming from people who are searching for a specificcar make model and even part names.So those are keywords you want to also add to your account.So if you see people are searching for model names, product numbers, I absolutely highly, highlyencourage you to add those keywords into your account and then informational queries, the last primarycategory of how people interact with search engines and we call this as in the buyer psyche awarenessstage uninformed.And these are your, in my opinion, from what I've seen, the most popular category of search query.So they're not really expressing anything other than they're looking for a specific type of productor service.So online desk chairs, websites that sell office chairs, they're not specifically telling me thatthey have a problem.They're not asking the question itself.They're not describing the cause.But rest assured that while these are the most popular ways that people talk to search engines, there'salways a problem that they're trying to solve.So if a person is looking for a new desk chair because they want a new desk chair, they're not happywith the desk chair they have.They just moved into a new office and they don't have one at all.They're have back problems.Maybe they're buying it as a gift for somebody.Maybe they're too hot in their chair and they want a cooler material.Maybe they're too cold and they want a warmer material.Whatever it may be, there's always a problem.Persons trying to solve is just a matter really of how do people express that?How do people go to the search engine and express that?And by understanding these six primary categories, whether people are looking for an answer to a question,they're writing out the question itself.They're describing the problem.They're describing the cause.They're entering brand names, parts.They're the most educated, direct.You have the most ability to capitalize on search intent using the using those bottom of the funnel,low hanging fruit search terms and keywords.Informational queries are going to be what makes up 80% for sure.At least I would say at least 80% of your account is going to be made up of informational queries,uninformed.You're going to have to really guess you're going to look at that analysis.But once you sort of.Understand how all these people or how your customers could be searching for your products and servicesyou're going to start seeing, Oh, och, this search gives me this information about the potentialcustomer.I should send them to this piece of content.This search tells me that a person is looking to buy it.Now they're using a name, a model, name, a part number.I want to send them directly to my sales page.This is somebody who's just looking for, you know, dresses that that are flattering in this sort oflight or for this type of party.I want to maybe send them to a category page on my site that also has good content or that has someeducational content because I'm learning to break down how a person is searching.I'm learning how to connect that up to a buyer psyche.And then I'm thinking of example, search terms and what that means for me.Remember, there's no hard and fast rule.We said that if we look at pop in our example and we look at a at a doctor.Right.A lot of these search terms down here could be relevant to both of these advertisers.But both poppin and doctors are completely different.They're not similar.They sell different things.They want different types of customers.There's there's not going to be a huge there'll be some overlap, but there won't be a massive overlapbetween the two advertisers.But yet a lot of these search terms will be relevant for both of them.And understanding again, what a person is expressing in their search term, whether or not there'san alignment between how they're perceiving their problem, what type of solution they're looking for,and whether or not you're going to be able to offer that solution to them.That's going to make you much better able to set up a better ad group structure, a better bidding structure,and most importantly, when it comes to keyword planning, where you're going to be sending that trafficto on your site.And if you don't have an area to send that traffic to and you find a search term, that's really good,let's say office chairs, let's say, oh, my back hurts at work.And that's a really high volume search.And that's a that's a search that you want to be able to advertise to, but you know that you're notgoing to be profitable.Just sending somebody searching for my back hurts at work to a page that sells an office chair.You could go and hire somebody to develop that content.You could go write that content for your blog itself.You could create those pages.You could identify by understanding buyer psyche, by understanding the six different ways people talkto search engines.You could then understand, determine or discover really good content opportunities, different piecesof content that you should either go or write yourself or have your client put together or hire a freelancerto put together for you, because that's going to allow you now to capitalize on search terms, capitalizeon keywords, capitalize on traffic that you would not have otherwise been able to profitably bid on.So that's an overview of the first phase of planning, understanding how people talk to search engines.And in the next couple lectures, we're going to talk about the different stages of the buyer's funneland how to begin predicting what types of search terms will lead to better sales, will lead to moreprofitability.And I will see you guys very shortly in the very next lecture.
