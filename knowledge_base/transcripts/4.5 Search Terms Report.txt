# 4.5 Search Terms Report

Welcome back.In this lesson we're going to cover the search terms report in more detail.When you go into your dashboard under Insights and Reports, you're going to see a tab on the left handmenu called Search Terms.The search terms report is a list of actual queries that triggered your ad.And there's two important things that you could do here.Well, one, let's call it three important things.One is you just get you look, you learn, you get a real good sense of what search terms are causingyour ads to appear.This is great research.In fact, this is some of the most valuable research you can possibly do inside Google Ads.I oftentimes tell clients that it's like, look, you can go and pay a market research firm tens ofthousands of dollars to try to gauge market interest, try to gauge how much people are searching forthings.But the best way to get that data is to start running a campaign and target certain search terms, targetcertain keywords, and then go to your search terms report.And you're going to see exactly what people are searching that are triggering your ads.Now, over the years, it's true that, um, Google has redacted this information more and more, whichis really frustrating.And there's nothing we can really do about that.Tools like SEMrush and Spyfu and SimilarWeb, they're all redacted because they're getting their informationfrom Google's API.So we're not really getting a clear sense.But anecdotally, by comparing search terms against each other and by seeing the volume, you're learningtwo things.You're learning which search terms are more popular than others.And you're also learning a lot about how Google matches your search terms to your keywords.So you'll get a very good sense exactly how exact match works, how broad match works, and how phrasematch works, etc. and Google's constantly tweaking and updating those modifiers and exactly how wideor how tight of a net.These search term modifiers cast from the search terms report.There are two things you could do.You could select a search term and you could add it as a keyword to your account.So if you want to positively and intentionally target a search term that might not have been a keywordin your account, and you want to give it its own dedicated budget, you could add that into the account.You could then eventually move it into its own ad group.You can move it into its own campaign.There's different tactics and strategies for, let's say, getting really aggressive with a specificsearch term you really like.But and I would say even a more popular way of using the search terms report, and this is somethingthat you should do every week, at least once a week, you should be looking at the search terms reportfor search campaigns and adding new negative keywords.Google makes it really easy to select a search term.If you say, hey, that search term somebody is looking for free, I sell fountain pens and somebodywas searching for a free blog hosting, and somehow Google thought that that was similar to fountainpens.I want to add that as a negative keyword to my account.So I would click the search term and click add as negative keyword.So here's an additional couple additional tips on powering up on the search terms report.So there are more search terms reported by aggregating misspellings.So if you if you export the data and aggregate misspelling, you're going to get more search term data.So misspelled search queries are matched to the correct keywords in your campaigns.Misspelled search terms are reported together with their correct spellings.So one of the things you could do is run an Ngram analysis.And there's more information on how to run an Ngram analysis in our library.Step by step guide, how to run this analysis, how to do it in Google Sheets.And you would use that Ngram analysis to aggregate search term data in order to analyze top performers.So you're going to eventually using an Ngram analysis, you could see which specific words are generatingthe most conversions.You can see which specific words or phrases generate the most amount of clicks, the highest conversionrate.There's all different interesting pieces of insights that you can generate from exporting your searchterms report, modifying it a bit with an ngram analysis, and then extracting key ideas almost likea word cloud.You're going to create filters when analyzing your search terms.So so just to get rid of maybe thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of, of searchterms that don't have enough value, volume or search terms that you don't, you know, you don't wantto analyze.You could create a filter that says if a search term contains a certain word or phrase, I don't wantto see it right now, but you could also filter search terms that had at least one click.You could filter search terms that had at least 50 impressions if you have a good search term, butit hasn't converted, I would not add that as a negative keyword unless certain parameters are met.If you have a search term that has ten clicks, 200 impressions, and no conversions, but you knowthat that's a good search term.You think that fountain pens for sale is a core search term, and you should be able to convert them.Do not go and pause that keyword.If there are hundreds of clicks and it's a decent click through rate, maybe I would say 500 clicksand nobody has purchased or nobody has begun checkout, then I would really be careful and comb throughour website.I would say is the usability functioning?Is our price point competitive?Is something broken?And then if I'm certainly confident that nothing on the user front end is broken, I would go pausethat keyword.But then a few days later I would relaunch that keyword in the campaign, sometimes under the hood.Google's just mismatching a search term or a keyword to the wrong audience.Pausing it, restarting it a few days later could sometimes yield very positive results.Let's say your CPCs are getting really high.Now remember, higher CPCs is not always a bad thing, but let's say your CPCs are creeping up to territory.That's making the campaigns not profitable.You could filter out your search terms in the search terms report directly within the Google Ads UI,where your CPC was more than a certain amount of a certain average CPC.So maybe it was higher than $7, and total spend for that keyword was above $100.As an example, just to give you a sense that this is a high volume important keyword where the clicksare really expensive, then you could look at conversion rates and AOV across that smaller cohort ofsearch terms.Does the AOV and conversion rate counteract the higher CPC?Are those search terms profitable even with higher CPCs?Because remember sometimes higher CPCs, that actually means you're getting higher quality traffic.But if those higher CPCs are generating a lot of clicks and a lot of cost, but your conversion rateand your AOV and ultimately your Roas isn't increasing and those keywords are not profitable, thenyou might have an option of pausing, or you might have an option of of bringing those individual searchterms and keywords into their own campaign.Going to a manual bidding strategy and intentionally bidding lower on those keywords to see if you canget volume at a lower bid and generate more conversions.In the next lecture, we're going to talk about brand inclusions in broad match campaigns, and I willsee you shortly.
