# 10.9 10 Strategies for Search Success

Welcome back.In this lecture we're going to briefly run through ten smart strategies for search success.Now this is relevant to PPC and SEO right.So this is general ways of thinking strategically about your campaigns.So this is not necessarily super tactical.But if you could incorporate these tools and build these tools into your toolkit, you're going to bea far more compelling marketer.Number one, brand trust.People tend to click on familiar trusted brands first on Google.You got to build credibility across all your marketing channels to get those first clicks.This is really important.You might not have much of an organic presence on Instagram or LinkedIn, right?Whatever it may be.But your competitors do.And you're thinking to yourself, I'm not going to invest on posting every day because I don't haveany followers.But you're missing something because posting every day on Instagram, I'm just giving you an example.This could be also writing a blog, or it could be fixing pages on your website or just building outthat presence.Little things that other brands are doing that yeah, you're right, it might not actually drive anyresults for you.It might not be so effective.You're not going to be able to look at your Instagram account and say, hey, I got 50 clients or 100sales, but people who are researching brands are going to be searching Google, searching the internetfor what other people are saying about those brands.And if they come to your Instagram account or your LinkedIn account or your blog, or an aggregatorsite or a review site, and they see demerits, they see something empty, something missing.The negative, the negative of the negative impact of not operating on a certain spoke of this overallhub.That's where you're going to feel the impact.It's not that you're going to feel the impact necessarily of the positive, that posting or being hereon this blog is generating sales, and this is one of the most important components and elements ofbrand trust and how to think about building a brand, because we always tend to think about what isthe value of this action, but we tend not to think about what is the downside of inaction.So brand trust is built by understanding the negative consequences of inaction.So if you want to generate better results from your Google traffic acquisition campaigns, from yoursearch campaigns pmax you, you should really make sure that your you're thinking about brand trust,brand validity, brand presence across all your other marketing channels.That way you're going to not experience the negative impact of inaction, and you will see an increasedclick through rate.When people are familiar with your brand and people feel good about your brand when they see that brandon Google in the search results.Click persuasion number two.When searching for new products, consumers are open to being influenced.So this is something again important to recognize.We tend to think like, yeah, my products, my product, my services, my service, but it's not true.Effective content, images, um, trust factors, rankings, those are all going to help you win clicks.There's when when somebody is buying, when somebody is in that purchase journey they're in one halfon on on one hand they're they have defense mechanisms they don't want to be sold to.But on the other hand, they're actually excited about a purchase.I'm currently just as personally like I'm, I'm I'm in the market for a new road bike.And it's a very long, arduous Sales cycle for me because I don't know.There's a lot to research.There's a lot of different brands, a lot of different models, a lot of different considerations.It's a big purchase.It's a meaningful purchase.Um, but I'm open to being influenced.I want brands to make me excited about their product, about their bike, about their features.Um, so imagery, uh, things like other pro athletes using their bikes, um, updates how easy it isto shop online.Right.Like all of these factors are, I'm totally open to being marketed to.I want to be influenced.I my heart is open to feeling that excitement.I'm waiting for that one brand, that one model, to make me feel so excited, so enthusiastic thatI pull the trigger.So think about that with your own products.How could you use better storytelling, better pictures, better imagery, better video, better copy,better content to induce that sense of inspiration, that sense of excitement into your consumer, becauseconsumers who are searching, actively searching to purchase something, they're also really excitedabout it.So match that level of excitement.Number three search ability in competitive markets.Use emotional engagement and alternative search features to attract clicks, especially on mobile wheresearchers are less spatially aware.So you have to make sure that that it's easy for people to find exactly what it is that they're lookingfor and that they can navigate all of your products effectively, right.Especially in competitive markets and competitive markets, can mean that there's just a lot of differentoptions out there.There's a lot of different options that are hard to differentiate from.So so you want to be there.You want to be there where people are searching.So that that means you want to make sure that your your content is mobile optimized.You want to make sure that your content is desktop optimized.Alternative search features can mean being on Google partner sites, right?So sometimes people are are are on well Microsoft or people are on Yahoo.People are searching products through Amazon.There's all different ways people get to finding products.So making sure that you've researched and understand all the different ways that people get to yourproducts and putting in the time and effort to be available, that might mean making sure that you havean account on Quora or an account on Reddit.Or there's right, like an understanding of how people are talking about and looking for the productsand searches that you, that you, um, that you sell.And when people are conducting those searches across different search engines and of course, Googlebeing the most effective is, is making sure that you're not at least making sure that you're at leastthere, that you're at least present that you're at least discoverable.Number four shop ability.If you're an e-commerce business, Google Shopping is an absolute must, and it means having a we havein depth Google Shopping content, but it means having a shopping feed.It means having a feed that is categorized properly.It means that you're you're making sure that you're prioritizing Google Shopping results over searchresults for e-commerce businesses.Google shopping is one of the most one of the most important tools in today's online shopping journey.Consumers decide between brands early on, oftentimes just through analyzing and browsing Google Shoppingresults.So if you're optimizing Google Shopping, you're going to have a much better chance of driving moreconversions.So that means high quality images.It means if you're running promotions that you're going into Merchant Center and you're you're addingyour promotions, you have your review Extensions.You're making sure that your imagery is clear, your your pricing is up to date and any other call outsand features like free shipping or again, other sales and discounts that you might be running.So Google Shopping is is a really, really important tool.And take the time to learn Google Shopping and to make sure that your that your effect, you're effectivelyutilizing all that Google Shopping has to offer.Number five map ability.I'm not sure if that's a word we made it up, but Google Maps has evolved and is continuing to evolveto really incorporate search behavior when it's users exploring reviews, ratings, prices, locations.It also offers that visual experience.When somebody is on Google Maps and they say, okay, I understand this location, this is where I live,this is how far this, this this, um, company is from me.I could call directly, I can go to their website.I could see reviews.It's a really, really rich and important experience.So make sure that when you're setting up your campaigns.You're using review extensions.You're using location extensions.Those are going to be important extensions when users are searching directly on Maps.google.com.Okay.Number six position zero.Aim for featured snippets.And the people also ask features to capture valuable voice search clicks.Okay.So so voice search on mobile phones is becoming more and more popular.And Google is monetizing voice searches with with ad results.So your featured snippets, your structured snippets, ad extensions and the people also ask featurewhen when your when when you see a Google search results page that say that there's a grid, peopleoften ask, etc. that's going to be content coming out of your responsive search ads.So Google is going to pull that content.And it could also be it could also be content coming from your site directly.Um, so it could be a, it could be a combination of sponsored and organic results.So you want to make sure that you have that content organized on your site, in your responsive searchads, where you're able to generate good visibility for your brand through some of these Google Informationproducts.Google is trying to get people to not.Google is trying to get people really to not leave the search engine results page in the organic, especiallyin the organic results.So the more you can optimize your content that Google features it in, the people also ask or the featuredsnippets sections, the more brand visibility that you're going to get.Number seven show and tell.Image and video assets are really, really important.Um, people, there's a growing number of people who are shopping through the Google Shopping tabs.Google images tabs.When you're thinking about your website content, Make sure that you take time and invest.Invest time.Resources, money on high quality imagery.Don't use stock photography.Don't use stock icons.Now with Midjourney and generative AI and and really, what used to cost thousands and thousands ofdollars of custom photography is now available.You can now do for pennies with a little bit of time and training.If you need to hire somebody, you could hire somebody.But, um, optimizing your images to be compelling, engaging that they tell a story, their emotional,um, is really important.And we're seeing a lot of this around fashion now where we're taking very drab and boring fashion photographyon websites and really telling a story with our photography without having to spend six figures on aphoto shoot on location in the Bahamas.Getting ahead.Number eight.This is The commitment you should make to developing rich information on your site.So I talk about this a lot in the landing page design course.People tend to think that short copy is always better, that we have to be oh, this is this page istoo long, there's too much scrolling, there's too much copy.And that's not true, because your goal is not to get the most amount of people to read your website.The goal is to get the most amount of people who are actually interested in your product and services.To read your website.Think about the last time you purchased or leased a car, or thought about a mortgage or, um, were.For me, I'm, you know, purchasing a road bike or buying a new computer.They're these people buying things is serious, even if it's not, even if it's inexpensive on an e-commercesite.More details about fabrics, about the materials, about the shipping policies, about the product isalways better, even if it's longer.We live in an information age where it's no longer that brands control the flow of information to customers,like it used to be, where customers would wait for a monthly catalogue and they would be really atthe whim of the brand.It's not the case anymore.Now consumers have access to the internet and they can get whatever information they want, how theywant it, where they want it, when they want it, and how much of it they want.And consumers are more informed and more well researched than ever before.So if you're not making an investment in educational content, where you could capture interest andactivity from people higher up in the search funnel, then you're going to be missing out on developingtrust with potential consumers while they're in that information gathering stage.And this could be as simple as a blog, as simple as educational videos, as simple as beefing up thecontent and enriching the content on your product detail pages.There's all forms of more substantial information and education.But it's not rocket science.You know your products.You know your services.You just need to write about them.Number nine copy magic.Become a better copywriter.This is important for ad writing.It's important for landing page writing.It's important for communication with leads.Become a better writer.There's a lot of great books.We have a reading section on our website, um, where I recommend a handful of my favorite books thathelp people become clearer, better writers, and also incorporating incorporating storytelling frameworksinto their writing.So by using distinctive and memorable copy to stand out and grab attention, you're going to get a betterclick through rate and you're going to get better on site engagement metrics.Um, and especially for thoughtful searches.So what is a thoughtful search?A thoughtful search is somebody who's expressing commercial intent, um, in their search term.There's something there.You know, I go back to the the lab grown diamonds question.We have a large client in the lab grown diamond space, and it's a growing segment.There's a ton, a ton of education and research that's important.And one of the things that really helped us be so impactful was we built an entire educational hub forthe client, sending paid traffic to educational pages, not to product pages.Somebody looking for what's the difference in cut and clarity between a rough diamond from a mine andlab grown diamonds from, um, built inside a lab?And that's a thoughtful search.Somebody's really looking for the difference in cut and clarity in these different types of processes.So we have substantial information in education, fact based, um, readable content that addressesthat, and that might be somebody still higher up in the funnel deciding where they want to go.Do they want to buy a rough diamond?Do they want to buy a lab grown diamond?They're not sure how they feel about it, but the fact that they've come to our site to get that educationand the product pages are just one click away, and now we can remarket to them that that's a win.And lastly, Downstreaming, instead of competing with popular comparison sites, use Google's searchfeatures to capture clicks in competitive markets.When you're when you are very likely in an industry where you're trying to you're trying to rank, let'ssay, for for keywords, you're even trying to bid on certain keywords.But oftentimes you have these aggregator sites that are very powerful, that have a ton of SEO traffic.They have a ton of advertising budget behind them, and it's hard to compete.So it might be like best iPhone case, um, best bathtubs.And those sites are going to be really hard to compete with because you have these larger aggregatorcomparison sites that sort of own those spaces.So go to Google Search, start typing in.Um, best.Okay.Say go back to go back to fountain pens.Best fountain pens.Um, and then Google might suggest best best fountain pens for, um, Moleskine notebooks.Best fountain pens for extra large nibs.Best fountain pens for um for interchangeable ink cartridges.Now those are going to be searches that you might have a better time ranking.So the Google search feature, the drop down feature where you get suggestions of what other peopleare searching, could be a very good way to circumvent, um, certain keywords and areas that are sortof just owned by either larger competitors or or those aggregator listing sites.Okay.So look, those are ten, I think, higher level discussion frameworks, ideas, ways of thinking aboutwho you are as a marketer, what your campaigns are going to look like outside of just the tactical,pragmatic, um, pragmatic use cases and tools within within Google itself.And at this point, um, with everything that we've learned about campaign structure, impression,share, competitive landscape and value based bidding, how it applies to lead gen and e-commerce,the campaign templates, sort of the common questions that we get, how to think about budgets and howto, I would say, enrich and enhance the supporting cast of strategies and and and ways of thinkingabout success with Google search Pmac shopping.You should be in a place now where you could set up a really, really awesome search campaign, andI'm excited to see what you guys are able to accomplish.And I look very much forward to seeing you in the next module for now.Happy building.Happy click through rates, especially happy returns.
