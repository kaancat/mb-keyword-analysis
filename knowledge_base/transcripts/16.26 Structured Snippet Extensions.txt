# 16.26 Structured Snippet Extensions

How do you Google that's fans and welcome back and this lecture we're going to cover structured snippetextensions.It sounds scary, but it's really not.They are very similar to call outs, but structure with a parent category.So we take a look at this image on the right hand side of the slide.We actually do see one of the ads has structured snippet extensions and that is right over here whereit says types.So credit card debt collection accounts, personal loans, medical bills, payday loans, that's a structuredextension because it's a certain volume or certain amount of subcategories that are that are organized,structured under the parent category called type up here, freedom, money, back guarantee, satisfactionguaranteed.Those are called extensions.They look very similar.They're structured differently.And Google actually sometimes favors structured snippet extensions.So if you can add structured snippet extensions, you absolutely should.Again, it's a predefined list of headers, and we're going to take a look at the account in a secondthat you can choose from, such as amenities, brands, courses, destinations.So if I was advertising my course catalogue, I would have a list of courses.I would say Google ads, masterclass, Facebook chat, bot advertising, landing page design, retargeting,etc. And that would be a structure and a bit extension that could be attached to the ad.Up to two different headers can show with one ad.So that means the two heading categories with with whatever four or 5 to 8 subcategories that are included,they help give potential visitors more context and information about your products, similar to callit extensions.Again, not all that different, just that they're more organized and Google actually does favor themover call it extensions and pro tip use structured snippets for practical product and service information,safe call outs for benefits and promos.So the structured sympathy, it is like this is a list of brands that I sell, right?I'm not promoting anything about the brands like free shipping and 20% off for three days and thousandsof of items in stock or best services in Arkansas for plumbing.Those are good call out structured snippets to be like, no, this is the brands of vacuums we sell.These are the brands of office chairs we sell.This is the courses that I sell, right?It's not like so promotional in nature, it's practical.So that's an interesting way and I think a good way to differentiate structured snippet from call outextensions.Let's go back into our Google Ads dashboard and add some structured snippet extensions together.So here I am back in Google ads and I have my structured snippet extensions and I'm going to twirl thatdown and I don't have any here.And again, of course, these are totally reusable and you could use them any time.And I'm going to open up a new structure, simple extension, and I'm going to keep my language in Englishand I'm going to select my header type.So for example, let's say four by brands, I'll use four for pop and I would use brands.So I would do something like NULL Steelcase.What else does Pop sell?We'll do the poppin brand, the poppin brand and whatever other brands.Right.So you could have a bunch.And again, under advanced options.I could I could I could select that this should be preferred for mobile, give it start dates and enddates and also schedule it based on different hours of the day.And I could preview to see what this might look like and brands exactly as we would expect it to see.That's structure snippets.Now, I could add multiple structured snippet extensions if I click Save.And I'm going to add a second structure sympathy extension.So maybe I would select something like shows.Maybe maybe we have upcoming events, right?So something like we have let's say we're calling just furniture fair in New York.At the Javits Center.And then we're going to be displaying at the LA Furnish furniture.Some symposium.And then we're also going to be Connecticut small biz.Breakfast?Nope.Only 25 characters, small biz, whatever.So those that say those are some.And I can preview what that looks like.You know, so structured snippets, again, not promotional in nature, just informational, practical.And if that's useful for your customers and if you're a travel agency or you're a reseller of otherbrands, and it's important that your customer and your customers care what brands you carry or let'ssee, you could do destinations what destinations?Your whether, you know, if destinations could be applicable to to hotels in the in the hospitalityspace or or travel agents or people who sell concert tickets.Right.You don't doesn't you could do all sorts of you could sort of squeeze different things into differentof these header categories, degree programs.Right.Great.If you're a school, these are the degree programs you offer.And sure, you could talk about that in the headline of your ad, in the description of your ad.And it's fine to be repetitive.There's no problem with being a little bit repetitive.Right?That's the name of the game.Get more space.The number one thing you want to do is just have a bigger ad than your competitors.That's what this is all about.So styles, types, right.Like almost if you if you guys like run through this list of headers for structured submit extensions,I really think that almost any single business in the world could figure out some information aboutwhat they sell that could fit into one of these headers and get approved by Google.So I certainly would I certainly would do that even more importantly than call out extensions, becausethey they'll get favored over out extensions, but do both because you could show Cox you could havean ad that shows your call out extensions and your structure symbol extensions and your selling extensionsand your phone number extensions.And then you have a monstrous killer ad.So that structured snippet in the next section, we're going to briefly talk about app extensions andwe'll take it from there.I will see you guys very soon in a few seconds.
