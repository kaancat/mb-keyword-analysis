# 2.4 How Does the Google Ads Auction Operate

Let's take a look at how the Google auction actually operates in an example.So over here on the left hand side we have five advertisers A, B, C, D and E.We could have given you fake names, but we totally ran out of juice.Um, so no more creativity A, B, C, D, and e.Now from top to bottom we have our max bid advertiser A $2, $3, $1.54 one.Remember, what is max bid?Max bid is what you're telling Google.You're willing to pay for a click.The most willing to pay.Now, just because you're using smart bidding like target CPA, target, Roas, that doesn't mean thata max CPC bid doesn't exist.It's just that you're not setting it.You don't see it.Google is inserting a bid in the auction on your behalf.Next column is quality scores.AD rank by multiplying the two and the position right.So advertiser A with a $2 bid and a nine quality score has the highest ad rank.Therefore, they're going to be the first ad on the page.And the CPC they pay is $2.The CPC paid by Advertiser B is $3.The CPC paid by Advertiser C is $1.50.Advertiser E a dollar.And the ad position with the lowest ad rank is zero, because in this example there's only four spotsat the top of the page.It usually comes out that you're paying just about what you what you bid.However, that's not always the case.Actual CPC is often calculated using a second price auction model, which is the ad rank of the competitorbelow you, divided by your quality score plus a pen.So if you see in your account in a manual bidding campaign where you bid $3 for your average CPC is$2.40, that's because Google is calculating it as a second price auction system.Again, it's the ad rank of the competitor below you, divided by your quality score plus a penny.
