# 16.22 Introduction to Dynamic Search Ads!

How do Google ads fans?And welcome back.In this lecture, we're going to talk about dynamic search ads, which is an interesting feature thatGoogle allows you to potentially set up in this step of creating a campaign.Of course, you're going to come back and modify it later and it removes keywords bidding, ad creation.It essentially tells Google, this works the best.By the way, if you have a larger website, a very organized website and lots of inventory, you mightbe running shop ad campaigns.And it might take a lot of time and effort to create customized campaigns for every single section ofyour site.That itself is not an excuse to use dynamic search ads who obviously only want to be using dynamic searchads if it's something which is going to be more profitable for you, which is why I suggest using dynamicsearch ads to potentially find areas of your site that you should then invest more time in.So Poppin might be a very good example of that.But first, let me just again describe what dynamic search ads are they?Google will use its index of your site or a page feed of specific URLs that you upload through the areaof the Google ads account where you upload this page feed.And I'll show that to you in a minute.It will read all the different content on your site.So it will take a look at the site map, your your categories, your product categories, your actualproducts.This could be for services as well.And Google then will then decide based on the search terms that a person is looking for on Google Searchand for Google, whether or not you should have an ad in the auction and they'll determine a bid andthey'll basically write that ad for you.When we go into the the the next section is going to be talking about ad group structure.But after that, what we talk about ad writing.You will go through creating dynamic ads step by step, and you'll see exactly the options you haveavailable to you.But just view it as a campaign that's sort of set up for you based on your website.So you would enter in first if I wanted to enable Dynamic Search as I would select this button.And I also want to say that if you're if this is a first time campaign and this is an account that doesn'thave a lot of data and you don't have a huge website, do not use dynamic search ads.It's a good tool to find other areas of a large site or other products in a large catalog that mightbe worth then going and creating your own manual campaigns for.But from the beginning, from the outset, I would not select to enable dynamic search ads but say thatI were so Google pre populates my domain so I could then Google in the next step.As I said up my ad groups, they're going to set up dynamic ad groups for me.So I'm going to keep the selected just so we see what it looks like.But in most cases you want to keep this D selected.You have the option below to use Google's index of my entire site.So if I'm popping and I'm back over here and I see that there's all these different sorts of categories,there's office supplies with lots of categories, design services with lots of categories.And I might be setting up some search campaigns for office chairs and file cabinets and tables, andI'm going to start there and then I might have a and this is something that I would probably do if Poppinwas a client.I would take the time to set up really thorough, really specific campaigns for three or four top sellingcategories.And then I would run a dynamic search campaign at a very light budget if maybe 5% of what the overallaccount budget is for a few weeks.And then I could look and see which areas of the site is Google giving me the most traffic for?It's a really great way to do research, right?It helps you figure out if there's a specific product.You might not have thought that corporate branding for desktop organization is a really hot category,and Google's been sending me some really good traffic.Now I see that happening through this dynamic search ads campaign.And again, it's not keywords I'm not choosing.I'm just telling Google, look at my entire site and you choose what ads to show for when, what theheadlines are, what page they go to, etc., etc. It's like totally in Google's hands, the entirecampaign, sort of like how we had automated bidding strategies to choose the bid for keyword.You're putting that in Google's hands over here.I'm saying my advertising is sort of in your hands, but it's not a bad way to get some good researchdone.And that's a use case, a very common use case that we use here in the agency.And it's actually quite effective and it's definitely better than some of the more archaic ways of researchthat we conducted in the past before dynamic search ads were a thing.And also this is providing that your client or you have the budget to put in towards dynamic searchads because there's no guarantee and it's there's a good chance that it won't be profitable or the moneywill be spent well.So you have to sort of say tell your client or you have to go into it with the attitude that I'm goingto be exploring a feature that Google has to see if it could work for us.And that's never a bad thing if it's done with control.So I could also just use URLs for my page feed.I can select that because I haven't uploaded a page feed yet.I could use URLs from from Google's index and from my page feed.A page is really just uploading a specific list of URLs you want them to look at.So, for example, I might not want let's say I don't want to run any ads to my design services so Icould upload a list of URLs that include everything on my site that I want Google to look at for thesedynamic search ads, except for the URLs over here.So if I look at I don't want them advertising for case studies about furniture.So I would do for business, business case studies.I would leave that URL out of my page feed when I upload it to Google and then I will get no ads comingto this area of the site through dynamic search ads.And Google will not read the content on these pages when they're determining whether or not they shouldshow an ad in the auction for a dynamic search ad.That's essentially what the search ads are.There's really not much more to them.They'll be they'll be more context given.I'll be able to give you more context when we get into the dynamic search ads ad in the in the chapterwhere we talk about actually creating ads and best practices for ads, and then we can look at how toanalyze results from dynamic search ads or creating a new dynamic search ad from scratch, dynamic searchcampaign from scratch.The other thing that I would recommend is, again, you know how much I am into organization and clarityof data.I would not want you enabling dynamic search ads inside a typical search campaign.If you want to test dynamic search ads, create a separate campaign for it.That way it's organized.When you go into your Google ads account, you look at your campaigns, you're looking at data.I know that this is the data conversions, clicks, impressions, click the rate cost per click averageposition for a search campaign that I'm actually optimizing working on.And these are my results and this is the stuff that's going on in my dynamic search campaign.So.Even if you want to run dynamic search ads for the sake of research, don't do it here.Do it in a new campaign.And I'm going to show you what it's what it looks like to create a dynamic search ads campaign fromscratch.So, in fact, I'm going to leave that unselected for now, our selected for now audiences.I want to skip audiences for now.I was thinking originally to go over in market segments, affinity audiences, remarketing lists howaudiences work.But then I decided that this should really be a chapter unto itself, a separate section, understandingaudiences and how that gets layered over actual campaigns.So I'm going to skip audiences for now.And when you're creating your campaign, you could also skip audiences.There's enough to deal with setting up the core campaign really well, where you don't have to createor or add any audiences to the campaigns yet.It's an extremely good idea and it's an extremely important idea to come back and then add audiencesto the campaign afterwards.And I'm going to show you how to do that in a future lecture when we talk about audiences.So we're going to twirl audiences back up and then we're going to go into the next lecture is aboutsite link extensions and all the different types of extensions we have available to us.And I will see you there in a couple of seconds.Looking forward to it.
