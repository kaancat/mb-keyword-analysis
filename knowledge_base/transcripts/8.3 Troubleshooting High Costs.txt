# 8.3 Troubleshooting High Costs

Welcome back.We're going to talk about troubleshooting high costs.So what if competition is too high and the conversion rates don't justify CPC.You're ultimately not earning enough revenue to justify the cost of the campaigns.So what what what what can you do in such a case?And here's a few tips.All of them can work in different scenarios.They can work in conjunction with one another.Number one, diversify your traffic sources.Uh, get more traffic from meta.Look at TikTok.Look at influencers.Look at organic search.Um, there's a ton of different ways to get traffic to your site.And if you diversify your traffic sources, if you're not totally relying on traffic just coming fromGoogle Search and from Google properties, then you could begin to leverage Google just for remarketing,and your remarketing clicks will likely have a much higher conversion rate.Number two, you could try adjusting your bidding strategy.You could pause the campaign and relaunch it with a new bidding strategy.You could change a bidding strategy.If you're running manual CPC, you can go to target CPA.If you're on target Roas and you're not generating that profit, you could increase the target Roasthat you're giving Google.So if you have a 150% target Roas, you're right, which is telling Google to aim for $1.50 back.You might go down to um, you might increase it to a 300% or 250% Roas.Yes, that might decrease your volume, but it might be worthwhile.Number three, and this is a really important one like we discussed.Optimize your landing page, work on your landing page strategy.Work on the clarity of your copy.Work on the page load speed.Work on navigation.Do some user testing.Try to increase your conversion rate because as conversion rate improves, your Roas improves.As conversion rate increases, your improves your generating more revenue without increasing additionalfixed costs.Fourth, improve your ad quality and your relevance.Think about your quality score that metric on a scale of 1 to 10, that really impacts your ad rank,and it impacts how much you're paying per click.And even if you're not looking at quality score directly, make sure that your headlines and your descriptionsare appealing, are engaging, are relevant to the search terms in that ad group.Make sure your ad groups have thematically related groups of keywords.If you improve the ad quality and relevance, you're going to have a higher click through rate.And if you have a higher click through rate, you're going to have a higher quality score, which isgoing to improve your ad rank, generate higher positions on the page, and you'll have to ultimatelypay lower and lower per click than you would have than you would have had to otherwise with a worsequality score.Number five refine your targeting.We spent a long time talking about all the different audience targeting Affinity Audiences, CustomAffinity, and Affinity Audiences in market segments.These are all additional layers that maybe you maybe you have them running as observation mode, butmaybe you could change them to targeting.And remember, when you change an audience segment from observation to targeting.You're telling Google to only show my ads to people who are searching for the keywords that I have inmy account and who also match this definition.They match whatever criteria is in that audience segment.And lastly, custom intent audiences across cheaper placements.So you might be looking at display network, Google search partner network, YouTube, and then you'relooking at custom intent audiences, people who have been searching for the types of products and servicesthat you offer, even if they're not on Google search right now, which is a more expensive placement.But maybe I'm running a custom intent audience on YouTube for people who are searching for my products,who have been using Google to search for my products and services, and I'm reaching them at a lowercost.So these are all some very good strategies you can use.If a niche or a or a campaign is too competitive to justify the higher CPCs associated with that, withthat market.
